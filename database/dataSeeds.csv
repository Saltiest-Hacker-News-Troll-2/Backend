If you only use your TV(s) with a games console, to watch recorded content or streaming content over the Internet, you don&#x27;t need to pay it. You are not required to provide access to an inspector from TV Licensing to confirm that your TV isn&#x27;t hooked up to an aerial or satellite box, but it makes life easier if you do.<p>The license fee costs £154.50 a year, or £52 if you only have a black and white TV (lord knows how given we&#x27;re now 100% digital), but the government pays it for you if you&#x27;re over 75 years of age.<p>This produces an income of ~£3.5 billion a year, and broadly breaks down into 55% spent on TV broadcasting, 17% radio broadcasting, 10% for the BBC World Service and the rest of it goes on the website, various apps, collecting the fee itself and the transmitter network across the country used by all terrestrial broadcasters, not just the BBC. It also pays slabs of cash into the EBU who produce the Eurovision Song Contest, amongst other things...<p>This results in nine national TV channels, 10 UK-wide radio stations, six national (i.e. England, Wales, Scotland, NI only), and 40 local radio stations.

There are two sides to this truth:<p>1. Most magistrate courts seem to spend a significant amount of their time dealing with non-payers, and there are people in prison for non-payment. IIRC, it&#x27;s the most common crime committed by incarcerated women in the UK. For context, it&#x27;s worth noting that the incarceration rate in the UK is about 1&#x2F;5th of the USA&#x27;s so the actual number is still quite low, but still...<p>2.

Now, everyone on the team understands that this library is suboptimal in a number of ways (most notably because the developer who wrote it is no longer with the company) and that it should be replaced by some alternative from Github. But this is a change that will require quite a few downstream changes (mostly because the way the existing library was used was not well-factored).<p>There&#x27;s no way of doing this change without it being a separate story. It&#x27;s just too big a change. It&#x27;s also not really something that is easy to do efficiently in an incremental fashion -- having two Kafka libraries simultaneously in the codebase is an even <i>worse</i> situation to be in than having a single, suboptimal library. And management is not willing to authorize a separate story for a &quot;refactoring&quot; such as this one, even though it would result in significant operational savings (less memory usage, fewer server restarts, etc).

Two were construction workers on the bridge (killed and injured respectively) and a person in a car passing under the bridge (injured).<p>The engineer had specified a 7 mm thickness of a part of a metal beam that was supposed to be 25 mm. She argued that the manufacturer should have realized that the drawing was a preliminary draft because it was undated, it was missing other information, and was &quot;clearly&quot; underdimensioned, but it was still manufactured and put in the bridge without anyone noticing until the collapse.<p>The reason the story was extra covered in engineering magazines at the time was because the prosecutor argued that the responsible design engineer should go to prison, and three others (the owner of the design firm, a manager at the construction firm, and a coordinator who led the project) should get suspended sentences. No one from the manufacturing firm was prosecuted.<p>The result of the trial was that the designer got a suspended sentence and a fine, and the design company was fined 1.5 million SEK. All others were freed.<p>Most people agreed that the lack of process was to blame (the design should have been checked by someone else at the design firm, they should have clear markings on preliminary drafts, things shouldn&#x27;t be manufactured without a formal handshake, and so on), but it&#x27;s still an interesting question where the line should be on personal responsibility.<p>Some forms of negligence in the workplace should be criminal, especially if it results in people dying, but it&#x27;s pretty harsh if an individual engineer is personally responsible for putting a 7 instead of 25 (possibly due to copy-paste of work in progress) in a drawing or in a piece of code.

ailideex,"Maybe a bit unrelated, I got used to Windows 2000, then window XP, then Gnome 2, then Gnome 3 came. So I stuck with Gnome 2, then moved to XFCE, and now with RHEL 8 I had to use Gnome 3 because there were no other options. Gnome 3 is an absolute horror show. I don&#x27;t know who made it, for who, and what the theory behind it is but I don&#x27;t see how it would be easier to use for someone non technical, my parents both understood how to use Windows 2000. It is just weird. It is harder to multitask as efficiently as I did in XFCE and Gnome 2. Gnome 3 is not simpler - it is just more convoluted.<p>And I feel this is a very similar situation with other tools. I edit code with vim, in a terminal. This is simple as dirt. I do it because it is simple as dirt.

So there are few options, either you have enough money so that you do not have to &quot;work&quot; again, and can spend your time making new tools. Or your current employer lets you work on the tools.

Does your entire community consist of stellar individuals with no faults?<p>Clojure problems typically start because some member of the team had enough power to convince their manager to do something in Clojure. It is not an organization that typically hires Clojure developers and has already people that know Clojure and can interview Clojure candidates. Clojure projects are typically a byproduct of having developers who are not satisfied with your language (Java most of the time) and try to seek out a better tool for the job.<p>It is not an inherent problem with Clojure or those people. Most developers need an organization to support them and lacking expertise around them they tend to fail in one way or another.<p>Programming Clojure requires huge amount of discipline and guidance with regards to the structure of actual code which you don&#x27;t have when you just had got hooked up on it and red through couple of articles. Lacking the discipline and guidance, the code reflects thinking process and understanding of Clojure by a single, novice developer who has the most power within the project. But that is because of how powerful and malleable lisp is.<p>Languages like Java force you to use particular solutions to particular problems and have huge amount of public guidance and expectations with regards to program structure which means the code is easier to read and interact with by other developers.<p>You would do better by, instead of being lazy in your thinking and offensive to other communities, to actually try to use your head and try to understand the problem.",40.19,22403322

I took a one semester long remedial class that served as a refresher to all high school level math.<p>After that I worked through my classes with a tutors help. Everything up to and including linear algebra and numerical analysis with the help of a extremely kind PhD student named Adnan. He had the patience of a saint and ended up becoming a very good friend.<p>The most valuable part of having someone like this available for an hour or two every week is that it increases your knowledge or understanding&#x2F;minute rate dramatically. It&#x27;s like having Google or Khan academy on steroids. Someone that did everything already and knows exactly what page of a text book to look lat to help you understand, but they don&#x27;t even need the textbook, because they know how to explain the concept you&#x27;re having trouble with.<p>To this day I work as one of many data lscientists on a team where we all have fairly diverse backgrounds. In fact I&#x27;m the only person that is only CS and does not have a graduate degree. I have a teammate that did her undergrad and Masters in mathematics and if I&#x27;m having a hard time with something math heavy after some googling, the first thing I do is ask her for a quick explainer. She does the same with me for CS or programming issues as well and I help her with informal code reviews.<p>I know this will seem like basic teamwork to a lot of folks, but far too often I see people in our industry exert huge amounts of effort to understand a difficult concept that likely someone they&#x27;re sitting a few feet away from has a very good understanding of and would be happy to help them with, so they&#x27;re not banging their head against the wall for hours. I had to have a similar conversation with my intern a couple years ago. She was spending hours doing pen on paper math to understand Kalman filters. Things went much more quickly after I talked to her about my process of working with my colleagues and asking for help when I didn&#x27;t understand something.<p>TL;DR Ask for help sooner rather than later.

Usability tests where developers literally sit down and watch someone install and use your library from scratch (I find a lot of developers do not like to do this). Things like, seeing where they have to look up documentation (and how they do it), what bugs they hit, and how often they make common mistakes. I think a lot of this could be logged e.g. A developer signs up, you have their email + API key, you can connect the dots between what doc pages they view, how often, and what errors they commonly run into.<p>2. Doing whatever it takes to minimize the time to aha moment. This is absolutely critical for any product design effort, but not many companies measure this if any at all when it comes to DX. I think Twilio and maybe Stripe are the only ones that may have had this as a key onboarding KPI.<p>Ultimately I think a majority of developers that are capable of implementing these things are quite technical and used to the general state of DX so they don&#x27;t view bad DX as much of an issue unless its really terrible.<p>Lastly, I really wish error messages would just be super informative. For example getting something like this &quot;undefined method `my_method_name&#x27; for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)&quot; still feels a bit cryptic to someone newer to programming, if you can also tell me the human readable variable that I used that caused this issue, the one that was nil, and the exact line (the stack trace purely by itself can be confusing) that little touch would go a long way. For example compare that error message to something highlighted in a different color that says &quot;The variable you used called &quot;contact&quot; on line 87 was found to be nil, this is likely causing this issue&quot;. This way when you run into the error and are scanning the stack trace, the computer is telling you as quickly as possible what may be wrong, again for a novice since the way the original error is written for someone more experienced is likely succinct enough.",95.69,22404472

Reports are timestamped. So delaying response to a report is a bad strategy -- reports are supposed to get precedence based on when they were filed, not based on when they were responded to, and the delay will be a black mark on your triaging record. This is the main objection to Cybernews&#x27; conclusion.<p>Similarly, I&#x27;d be a little surprised if one company had a presence on multiple bug bounty platforms. The standard flow is that you find a bug, look up the company, and report it to them using whatever they tell you is their standard. I&#x27;ve seen many reports including text like &quot;Hello, I sent you this report by email, and I was told I should file it on HackerOne&quot;. (Including this text, if it&#x27;s true, is a good idea for multiple reasons.) Centralizing reports makes many things more convenient -- including timestamp comparisons, but much more importantly it makes checking for earlier duplicate reports easier.<p>I&#x27;d also be a little surprised if HackerOne allowed their triagers to file reports for the same companies they do triage for. They hire triagers from the researcher pool, and they do allow triagers to hunt bounties on their own time, but it would be a common-sense protection to prohibit them from reporting to the same companies they triage for. I haven&#x27;t worked directly for H1; I don&#x27;t know whether they have such a policy or not.<p>In conclusion, there is some potential for abuse, but it&#x27;s unlikely that a triager can abuse the system in the most obvious way, by personally stealing reports that come to them for triage. I&#x27;d worry more about a triager prioritizing their friend&#x27;s report over a stranger&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t think triager abuse is a significant risk of reporting through H1.

The main table had 500+ columns of ~140m rows but with very low entropy (e.g. gender, city&#x2F;district). Each column had its own file. And queries were relatively simple. At 300MB&#x2F;s (at the time) it was pretty fast. Data was mmap since as in most real life scenarios, the access to the columns had a power law distribution. Most queries could resolve with RAM data (~24GB&#x2F;s at the time). Data size was over 10x the size of RAM (~128GB). IO is fast if you do mostly sequential access. Note server NVMe today is ~8x faster so the principle still applies.<p>The main thing here is the simplicity of the architecture and combining HyPer, careful mmap usage, and having SQLite engine do all the other non-critical work.

You give the perception of power, but there are plenty of things in society we deal with by a form of &quot;banning&quot; (such as incarceration) in which we judge the ban to be good regardless of the power it gives people, or the ideas they represent or practice. Locking up child abusers, for instance, may give the spectre of child abuse power, and highly-publicized instances may fuel the moral panic around &quot;strangers out to get your children&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they should not be locked up.<p>In civil society, we are justifiably afraid of many ideas - I don&#x27;t know anyone who wouldn&#x27;t be afraid of a Nazi-style dictatorship, or its prospect. Fear can be a legitimate way of preventing bad things from happening. I fear dying in a house fire, thus I take certain precautions when cooking. In the same way, a demonstration of power <i>over</i> a person or idea may outweigh the power supposedly given to that idea by banning it.<p>The key is a balance; it may well be that you get an instance of the Streisand Effect, but it has to be shown that the consequences of that outweigh the very material consequences of such ideas coming to fruition in real life. For example, many people don&#x27;t know who Barbara Streisand even is, and if they do, they likely don&#x27;t know about the pictures of her house. The very canonical example of the Streisand Effect shows a short-lived controversy about the actual matter and ensuing attention for a few months after the incident.

ditonal,"I got interested in programming in 2000 and graduated with a CS degree in 2009. Throughout the 2000s (remember this was post-dot com) I got told software was a bad field to get into for two reasons:<p>1) The advent of advanced tooling would make software engineers unnecessary. Tools like Visual Basic and UML diagrams were the tip of the iceberg of &quot;visual coding&quot; where a business person could just specify requirements and the software would be automatically created.<p>2) Jobs were all going to go overseas. There is no reason to pay a programmer in California 10x what you can pay someone in Mumbai. It&#x27;s better to study something like finance where the secret domain knowledge is held within the chambers of ibankers in Manhattan. The future of tech startups is a few product managers in NYC outsourcing the coding work to India.<p>There&#x27;s also a 3rd argument that gets floated around that the field will be oversaturated, &quot;everyone&quot; is learning to code, etc. In 2015 I asked a startup for 125k and they told me, while that did seem to be market at the time, they thought salaries had peaked and were going in the opposite direction. In 2020 you probably can&#x27;t hire a bootcamp grad for 125k.<p>Since then the field has exploded and wages have gone off the charts, but I still hear the same type of arguments over and over.<p>In 2020, you hear stuff like:<p>1) AI is the future, it&#x27;s going to automate away all of the menial programming jobs.<p>2) Bay Area is overcrowded, all the jobs are going remote. The future of tech startup is a few marketing execs in SF outsourcing the menial tech work to flyover states.<p>Personally, I didn&#x27;t believe the hype then and don&#x27;t believe the hype now. I find it amusing that the author questions the wisdom of Google for not using AI to automate development, as if that&#x27;s never occurred to Google.<p>Of course the author is right that tech is a treadmill, new skills move into the spotlight while old ones become outdated, although even then the mass of legacy code means consultants will have lucrative jobs taking care of it for a long time.<p>In my experience, new tooling always creates more software jobs, not less. Software is not like high frequency trading, the more people that compete to make software, the more people we seem to need to make software.<p>Sure, Bay Area is getting insanely expensive, but Google still tries to fit as many as it can into Mountain View, Facebook still crams as many as it can into Menlo Park. Every 3 months some VC will have the bright idea that, what if we just pay people to do the lowly engineering work somewhere else and just have execs in the Bay Area? And 99% of those startups go nowhere and Google is worth a trillion dollars.<p>There is a very intuitive line of reasoning that goes, software can be done my machines and software can be done anywhere. There is a thread of truth to both those narratives, but it leads people to very incorrect conclusions that there won&#x27;t be as many software jobs in the future and they will be done in cheap places.<p>Despite all intuition, and all the logical narratives about costs and automation, a group of people dedicated to technology in the same physical room have defied that intuition. Virtually every extremely important software company grew in the West Coast of the USA, in some of the most expensive places in the world, and the more software tools have improved the more headcount these companies have had.

Some are better than others.<p>I&#x27;d break the suggested strategies into a few general categories. You can be so intrinsically motivated that you never really encounter this problem in the first place (1). You can play psychological games to try and make it harder to lose interest (2, 3, 4, 8, 9). You can alter the workload in a way that makes it more interesting, but may cause quality to suffer (5, some 7, 10, 11, 12). You can rearrange the work in a way that actually creates <i>more</i> work, but also helps it stay interesting for longer (6, some 7, 10, 11, 12).<p>I find that those last two categories tend to go hand-in-hand in programming, too. So finding ways to help yourself just muscle through the boring part really is preferable in a professional setting.<p>OTOH, for fun projects, both sock knitting (and mittens) and development, I tend to go for those latter strategies. The corollary here is that I try not to knit socks for others, and you probably shouldn&#x27;t take a dependency on anything I&#x27;m not getting paid to write.",31.82,22407569

But the drug-discovery technique in use here may not be &quot;playing better&quot; in terms of producing higher-quality predictions.<p>To extend the chess metaphor:<p>- Deep Fritz is a stronger player Deep Blue even with 4% as much computing power. This story does not appear to be an algorithmic breakthrough of that source.<p>- Deep Blue lost to Kasparov in 1996, then beat him in 1997 with double the computing power. That&#x27;s a clear improvement in play, but not an improvement in efficiency. This story might represent such a change, modelling more prospective drugs to test higher-confidence candidates.<p>- If an AI that can only win 2% of games against humans plays 10 games, it has an 18% chance of beating someone. But over 100 games, it has an 87% chance of a win. This result might be a team with a larger testing budget claiming the &#x27;first win&#x27; without any AI-side improvement.<p>- If a dozen grandmaster-level chess AIs play GMs, one of them will have to get the first win against a human. Labeling this result a &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; in AI terms might be outright publication bias among equivalent projects.<p>As far as the <i>drug</i>, none of that really matters, except that efficiency improvements would have more potential to increase drug discovery. The drug itself is still useful, and the discovery is a proof of concept; in 1980 no possible computer would have beaten Kasparov.

It was outsourced to an Indian company because no one in Symantec understood the first thing about programming on Unix.  Turns out that the guys in India didn&#x27;t understand programming on Unix, either.<p>The Indian developers basically just transliterated the Windows code to Unix, and got it to compile.  Then they shipped it.  That&#x27;s when the real problems started, and I was brought in.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve never claimed to be a developer.  At the time, I was a consultant and Unix sysadmin, but the concept of &quot;DevOps&quot; had yet to be born.<p>What I could tell them was that, in 1996, basing your Unix implementation on Solaris 2.5 (not even Solaris 2.5.1) was a bad idea, because there was a whole host of things wrong with that ancient version of Solaris, and if they wanted to be on that platform then they needed to be on a much more modern version.<p>Secondly, threading on Unix at that time was ... problematic ... and that was true even on the most modern versions of Unix that were available at the time.  Multi-process programming worked well, however.  On Windows, the reverse was apparently true.  So, naturally the outsourcing developers used threading, and they used threading on an ancient version of Unix that had about the worst possible implementation of threading.  Oy.<p>Of course, learning these things at this stage didn&#x27;t help Symantec.  They had already outsourced their aircraft and gotten an Albatross back in return.<p>I did help them develop a testing regime that could relatively accurately simulate a real-world distribution of mail message sizes and types, with a real-world distribution of supposedly infected messages, and then beat the holy living crap out of the server trying to push that volume through as quickly as possible.<p>And I did get called back to teach a class on Unix to the lead QA team in Denver, so that they could try to support NAVIEG on Solaris 2.5.<p>But so far as I know, the consulting company I worked for never got called back to help them actually fix their design problems with the code, and I think that project probably died a pretty quick and vicious death.<p>Also, so far as I know, no one at Symantec ever again tried to develop or support any code that would run on any flavor of Unix or Unix-like OS.",29.6,22408411

Avamander,"&gt; What kind of bullshit does it do?<p>It doesn&#x27;t utilize a hardware-backed secure secret storage on Android (~80% of marketshare in EE if I remember correctly). This means vital key material is unsafe from any compromise, just a plain file somewhere. This means that they have to go into a lot of effort to detect clones, which is also certainly not infallible. Cloning or compromising an ID-card of Mobile-ID is way way harder with it&#x27;s audited security.<p>The technical overview describes how key is generated on the device and half of it is sent to AS SK&#x27;s servers. There&#x27;s no security benefit in that (they can&#x27;t really verify you&#x27;ve deleted their half of the key from your device), except that now AS SK has half of your private key. In general their technical overview gives the feeling that like they want to pull wool over people&#x27;s eyes, it&#x27;s IMHO a bad sign.<p>It also totally lacks any privacy, every login you do is logged and counted. SK AS shouldn&#x27;t mandatorily have that metadata.<p>It relies completely on their centralized servers, they go down, your authentication and signing goes totally down. Neither service owners or their clients can do anything about that. Identity mustn&#x27;t be like that.<p>It&#x27;s totally proprietary, thus their claims about security can&#x27;t be easily verified, and it&#x27;s limited to their blessed OSs (and versions). If they go bankrupt or similar, the identities of all those people are in jeopardy.<p>It&#x27;s also expensive for server administrators and thus has a high barrier of entry. Identity and security shouldn&#x27;t be behind a paywall for neither side. The web has LetsEncrypt and now a lot more sites are protected, the web is better off, SK AS has done the opposite.<p>In comparison, ID-card&#x27;s PKI is usable for free, supported in every system (that can do TLS basically), entirely FOSS if you wish, the hardware is much more secure (EAL6+), it doesn&#x27;t mandatorily leak metadata, doesn&#x27;t rely on a centralized proprietary server to work.",62.4,22408642

If the Allies had resisted Hitler strongly in his early stages, even up to his seizure of the Rhineland in 1936, he would have been forced to recoil, and a chance would have been given to the sane elements in German life, which were very powerful especially in the High Command, to free Germany of the maniacal Government and system into the grip of which she was falling.Do not forget that twice the German people, by a majority, voted against Hitler, but the Allies and the League of Nations acted with such feebleness and lack of clairvoyance, that each of Hitler&#x27;s encroachments became a triumph for him over all moderate and restraining forces until, finally, we resigned ourselves without further protest to the vast process of German re-armament and war preparation which ended in a renewed outbreak of destructive war.

heartbeats,"Both of you are describing the same concept :)<p>&gt; In economics, insurance, and risk management, adverse selection is a market situation where buyers and sellers have different information, so that a participant might participate selectively in trades which benefit them the most, at the expense of the other trader. A textbook example is Akerlof&#x27;s market for lemons.<p>&gt; The party without the information is worried about an unfair (&quot;rigged&quot;) trade, which occurs when the party who has all the information uses it to their advantage. The fear of rigged trade can prompt the worried party to withdraw from the interaction, diminishing the volume of trade in the market. This can cause a knock-on effect and the unraveling of the market. An additional implication of this potential for market collapse is that it can work as an entry deterrence that leads to high margins without additional entry.<p>&gt; Buyers sometimes have better information about how much benefit they can extract from a service. For example, an all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant that sets one price for all customers risks being adversely selected against by high appetite and hence, the least profitable customers. The restaurant has no way of knowing whether a given customer has a high or low appetite. The customer is the only one who knows if they have a high or low appetite. In this case the high appetite customers are more likely to use the information they have and to go to the restaurant.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Adverse_selection"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Adverse_selection</a>",15.31,22409366

If we want to see the field of psychedelic research continue moving in the right direction, it&#x27;s important that we stay rigorous with our logic and reporting.<p>Can you imagine if a brand name drug was found to have a side effect of triggering psychotic episodes in vulnerable patients, and the drug company responded with &quot;To be fair, all drugs have some risk&quot;. HN would be all over that faulty logic if it came from a corporation, but for some reason psychedelics get to play by a different set of rules.",27.32,22409646

Tests should be easy and you should want to write them.<p>3 - Make tests blazingly fast and parallelizable.  That means, you can write two (or more) tests that hit the database (or some other source of state) and it doesn&#x27;t matter that they are operating on different views of the universe, they shouldn&#x27;t collide.<p>4 - be opinionated about deployment, so that those rube goldberg tricks you have to do to put into prod are testable and reproducible.",14.19,22410179

The CPU has a BOOTROM which can cryptographically verify code blocks, the PCH has a CPU that can do the same, and the firmware has signed code blocks. It starts out with the CPU reading an authenticated code block which contains further code to verify other blocks.<p>Problem is that you still read SPI Flash which can be modified out of band, so after the CPU ROM reads the ACB it continues reading code which can be altered and if the UEFI firmware is set to &#x27;verify but don&#x27;t stop running&#x27; mode, you can modify all you want and it will work.

rumanator,"&gt; Why are people so obsessed by AWS? It is one of the most expensive hosting solutions that tries hard to lock you into their ecosystem.<p>I agree with you, and that&#x27;s why I try to get the point of view of those who actually decide to adopt AWS. They aren&#x27;t crazy or stupid, and as AWS is the world&#x27;s leading cloud provider then it&#x27;s highly doubtful that the decision is irrational and motivated by ignorance.<p>So far, the main fallacy with regards to companies picking AWS is that cost is relevant. It isn&#x27;t. AWS might overcharge a lot, but truth of the matter is that for any sizeable corporation it&#x27;s irrelevant if they spend 200€ or 400€ on their cloud infrastructure. It&#x27;s far less than a salary and it&#x27;s even less than the bill for some office utilities. So once the infrastructure foot is in the door then why would management worry about cost? What they do care about is uptime and development speed, because that has direct impact on productivity, and thus value extracted from salaries. If a particular service provider enables you to show tangible results in no time at all (see spin up a database or message broker or workflow in less than nothing) then they don&#x27;t mind paying a premium that matches, say, their air conditioning bill.",30.52,22412049

The two-way&#x2F;retroactive nature of this is really helpful compared to e.g. notion where if I reference page A on page B, I have to manually create a link on page B to page A, creating a fragile web of unmaintainable connections.

drewg123,"The problem is that, used properly, IOMMUs are horribly expensive.<p>Consider a NIC driver where you&#x27;re mapping an outgoing packet for DMA.  What used to essentially be a virtual to physical translation becomes a virt to phys + entering the phys in the iommu + removing the mapping when the transmit is complete.   This is expensive for hardware and software reasons.  At one point I benchmarked a 100g setup on linux, and with the IOMMU enabled, we lost about 90% of the bandwidth and most of the  CPU time was spent in lock contention over the red-black tree that managed the IOMMU tables. This was 5-ish years ago, so perhaps things have gotten better.<p>So that makes people want to just enable the IOMMU for SR-IOV (and full device) pass-thru to VMs.  This is cheaper, since you just set the mapping up when you allocate phys mem for the guest, and tear them down when freeing phys mem.<p>MacOS used to use a really cool trick where they pre-mapped all mbufs into the IOMMU.  That made network traffic transmit and receive comparatively fast.  However,it also prevented lots of optimizations that modern operating systems use for zero-copy IO (like attaching pages from sendfile directly to mbufs, similer to skb_frags).",72.69,22413608

A few hypothetical ideas, in order of extremity.<p>1) all women get gold features (see who likes you, unlimited swipes, etc for free)<p>2) only men are subject to double opt in (eg women can message without having been liked by the recipient)<p>3) double-opt-in is based on something ELO-ish. The height of the contact initiation barrier is proportional to your attractiveness as determined by the crowd (although this creates some extremely perverse incentives for large-scale deception).<p>I think all of these rules would exacerbate the existing dynamic, and I&#x27;m unconvinced that&#x27;s healthy for either side. As others in the thread have pointed out, I don&#x27;t know any single women who are having the time of their lives on dating apps, despite the 80&#x2F;20 hypotheses etc. They may have a huge statistical selection advantage, but in practice that seems to be like hunting for the single best meal of your life on a 10 mile long, all-you-can-eat buffet of food you mostly don&#x27;t care about.<p>Which is the source of my pet hunch:<p>All dating apps are effectively identical, having converged on a pitifully vanilla product that&#x27;s easy to monetize and scale, and that prioritizes  volume over fit.

Large scale online communities erode the advantages of actual individuality in favor of performed individuality in a way that ends up feeling dehumanizing for everyone.<p>Look at reddit: the popular subreddits have a monoculture that&#x27;s predictable, uninteresting, and easily gamed, and so people game it, making it worse, until it&#x27;s parroted itself into a tired caricature. Meanwhile, tiny subreddits exist with smaller tribe dynamics and have much more robust, varied, and interesting experiences.<p>IMO the thing we actually need is subreddits for dating, so that people can self-select into smaller, higher-signal tribes, rather than pretending that everyone should have to card sort everyone in their metropolitan area.<p>In a way, this is a different kind of darwinian: encouraging finches to lean into divergence.",38.04,22413766

The problem to me is also due to the very high price the original stuff is sold at. Technology has progressed to a point an electronic instrument or effect can be built at a fraction of what would be the price 30 years ago, still mainstream producers sell at absurd prices. As an example, I can build with 15 euros in an evening a fantastic sounding germanium transistor fuzz face clone with mosfet input stage and LDR compressor, place it in a box and make a small profit by selling it at €40.

squeaky-clean,"&gt; Some Eurorack modules are more or less literal clones of &quot;famous&quot; designs. The only difference is the graphics. So cloning is not exclusively a Behringer issue.<p>Typically clones are made for vintage and hard to find gear, which Behringer (and many others) have done for years without issue. The specific recent problem with Behringer and why it&#x27;s angering many members of the synth community is Behringer is actively cloning and undercutting products being made right now.<p>In the link above about the TD-3, the &quot;DevilFish&quot; mod is a mod  Robin Whittle does for the out-of-production Roland TB-303. Behringer cloned the TB-303 to make their own unit, the TD-3. Not many people are upset about this.<p>They then contacted Robin Whittle, who created and sells kits for the DevilFish mod, and after being unable to come to an agreement with him, simply used his mod in their synthesizer. This is legal because there are no patents on the mod.... Kind of a dick move though.<p>Purely speculation, but they feel like the kind of company that would clone a Mutable Instruments module and conveniently ignore the GPL portion of the license when it suits them to.<p>They also hype product announcements in a way that seems like they&#x27;re trying to poach customers. They didn&#x27;t announce their Model D clone until just after Moog put up pre-orders for their re-issue. Then Behringer took over 2 years from announcement to sale. They&#x27;ve done similar things with Roland announcements. Releasing a &quot;We&#x27;re working on something very similar!&quot; image on Facebook the same day as a sale announcement for a new product, and then never releasing the Behringer item.<p>And Lastly, Uli Behringer is a bad member of the community. He constantly has posts deleted by GearSlutz moderators for having false information. He attempted to sue several members of Dave Smith Music for talking negatively about him on forums outside of their day-jobs.<p>&gt; I expect they&#x27;ll produce some original synth designs when they&#x27;ve exhausted the clone market<p>They already have some lovely original designs like the Neutron or Deep Mind by the way.",47.67,22414330

Also you have a solution that works only on one program, while the rest of the system DNS requests remain unencrypted, that is bad.<p>Browsers shouldn&#x27;t implement DNS theirself, and should use operating system APIs to do all the DNS queries. That is how networks work, and doing that differently creates problems (imagine if every program has its implementation of DNS over HTTPS, you have to configure correctly the DNS server in each of them, and good luck debugging it when one implementation is broken...)<p>As a technical motivation, HTTPS in an high level protocol, and using it for DNS is kind an overhead.

Software development and the job aspects can be completely independent - and tightly coupled.<p>So, really, the meta of software development as it pertains to your job would likely be more about the meta of your organization. You could try to scale up those ideas to a whole career and across all organizations but it&#x27;s gonna be hard. What works in one place won&#x27;t work in another - but if you know how to recognize the meta within each organization, you can find a meta that you think you&#x27;ll do well in, and then try to work at places that follow that meta. But - honestly - I&#x27;ve found that hard as many organizations aren&#x27;t very upfront with how they actually operate.<p>We&#x27;ve all likely found that being really good at software development doesn&#x27;t end up getting you a reward at your place of employment.

It could be because the place you&#x27;re working at is very team oriented - your team does well, you all get rewarded. It could be purely that your manager dictates it and won&#x27;t recognize you. It could be that you&#x27;re in an organization that doesn&#x27;t value software engineers at all. It could be that you&#x27;re good at the software development but haven&#x27;t engaged on the more social aspects and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s key to getting rewards.

logfromblammo,"If we define larks as those whose circadian cycle leads the day-night cycle, and owls as those whose circadian cycle lags the day-night cycle, it&#x27;s easy to hypothesize reasons for lark dominance in the civic schedule.<p>Hypothetically, say local sunrise is 6 AM, and sunset 6 PM, a lark rises at 5 AM and retires at 9 PM, and an owl rises at 7 AM and retires at 11 PM.<p>If the lark wishes to be immediately productive on waking, they might generate noise, vibration, or odors in the owl&#x27;s sleeping area, or may simply resent the owl for continuing to sleep while the lark has started working, and thus may wake the owl intentionally.  If they have a task that requires cooperation, they could either wait 2 hours for the owl to wake, or go rouse them immediately.  At that point, the owl has had 6 hours of sleep, and could probably function on that amount for that day.  The owl, on the other hand, can work cooperative tasks immediately on waking, as the lark is already awake, and has no reason to ever awaken the lark prior to the natural conclusion of their sleep cycle.<p>The converse act to the lark waking the owl 2 hours early is the owl keeping the lark up 2 hours late, after which the lark will likely just wake later.  Each has a 2 hour sleep deficit, but the owl would have been re-clocked by daylight all day, and thus it would be more difficult for them to retire early after being awakened early (unless the weather was gloomy and overcast).  They would also desire to awaken 2 hours later than usual the next morning.  But there the lark is again, waking the owl up early again.  The lark can cause the owl to be chronically sleep deprived, and the owl cannot effectively retaliate.<p>So the owl can, at best, create rules that prohibit larks from disturbing others&#x27; sleep before &quot;a reasonable hour&quot;.  Commuting, artificial lighting, time zones, and daylight savings have all combined to make that &quot;reasonable hour&quot; less reasonable.<p>Daylight savings is a particularly execrable lark tradition.  While the owl is sleeping, the lark changes all the clocks, and then wakes up the owl, waving the clock in their face, so the owl does not murder the lark immediately.  And then the larks only relent when the evidence of the sunrise would reveal the ruse.  Only the larks have any real incentive to redefine civil time to get the owls out of bed earlier.  So when someone says, &quot;your body-clock is messed up,&quot; the best response is, &quot;your civil time is messed up,&quot; and then roll over for a few more zees.",36.12,22417127

simias,"This is kind of a sub-issue but from the infographic in TFA:<p>&gt;Q. Will DoH lead to a greater centralization of DNS, which will be bad for the Internet as a whole?<p>&gt;A. We agree that centralization is bad for the Internet. Today in practice, DNS is
&gt;centralized because consumer devices are locked to the DNS service of the ISPs.
&gt;And just five companies control over 80% of the US broadband internet market.<p>For one thing, 5 independent providers <i>within the same country</i> is not exactly
centralized in my opinion. As far as I understand it Americans don&#x27;t always
effectively have the choice of which ISP they can use, but that&#x27;s not a
technological problem. You won&#x27;t solve monopolistic and anti-competitive
practices with a new layer 7 protocol.<p>Furthermore what does Mozilla mean by &quot;locked to the DNS service of the ISPs&quot;,
do they block DNS queries to other services? Here in Europe I can switch to a
different DNS any time I want. Sure, it&#x27;s easier to stick with the defaults
and most people will do that but &quot;locked&quot; is a strong word which I suspect is inaccurate in this case.<p>By that definition of &quot;centralized&quot; you could argue that email is effectively centralized since most people just use the free service provided by a handful of providers.<p>&gt;The immediate impact of Mozilla enabling DoH in Firefox will be less
&gt;centralization, not more because it shifts traffic away from large ISPs, and
&gt;provides users with more choice, while respecting enterprise DNS
&gt;configurations.<p>So 5 ISPs meant that the service was effectively centralized, but (at this time)

_hardwaregeek,"Fencing exhibits this phenomenon nicely. Fencing does not come even close to mimicking a real sword fight. One reason for this is right of way, basically the idea that the person who attacks first gets precedence and the onus is on their opponent to defend against the attack before attacking themselves. However what is defined as an &quot;attack&quot; in fencing is very different from what a layperson would assume. Really, it&#x27;s defined as forward movement without a clear intention to take the blade. Which means that tactics such as advancing with ones arm held back are rewarded.<p>A lot of people, upon hearing this, respond with something along the lines of &quot;fencing is stupid! We should make our own sword fighting system that encourages real fighting!&quot;. HEMA is a nice example of this. Putting aside the questionable logic of a martial art based around swords, what inevitably happens is that as the system develops, people want to compete, to see who is the better fighter. Since they clearly can&#x27;t judge fights by, well, murder, they need to come up with a rules and points system. Once this system develops, someone starts to realize &quot;hmm, if I do x action, I can win fairly easily&quot;. Thus a meta develops. Once a meta develops, everybody starts using the meta to win and the fighting becomes less mimicking killing people with a sword and more competing in a sport.<p>Some argue that the way to prevent this is to not have competitions or rules. But...then you have a bunch of people waving around swords with no clue as to whether it&#x27;s actually effective.<p>Side note, fencing has had a few of these major meta developments in its history too.

He took x-rays and found out I had an infection growing since the initial root canal[2].  He prescribed antibiotics and a massive pain reliever (Percodan[3]).  It took four weeks for the infection to go down enough for surgery.  The doctor said it might come back because they might not get it all.  It took two more operations (5 and 10 years later) to fix it all.<p>1) given what&#x27;s happened to so many other people, I feel I got off cheap.<p>2) no, the IHS dentists did not see this growing and it was probably slowed by the multiple antibiotic prescriptions for step throat in high school.<p>3) Took it for two weeks, I&#x27;m still amazed I was functional enough to take tests and program.

toast0,"&gt; Erlang can kill a process, but does not have cancellation, which causes a process to be halted and throw a cancellation exception from the point at which it was halted so that clean up can be performed while unwinding.<p>Indeed, Erlang does not have a way to induce a catchable exception into a process stack from outside the process. Processes are isolated, and the way that processes interact with the world is through their mailbox.<p>The Erlang way (TM) is to let your processes crash (or be killed), but be supervised and restarted, and the new process will handle whatever state the world is in, and bring it to a good state (or it won&#x27;t, and it will die, and the supervisor will die, and the system will restart, eventually).<p>You could certainly pepper you code with something like<p><pre><code>   receive cancel -&gt; throw cancel after 0 -&gt; ok end
</code></pre>
In places where you might want to be cancelled, and send a cancel message as appropriate, to get something like what you&#x27;re asking. But it wouldn&#x27;t feel very Erlangy, and looking at the results of being explicit about everywhere you might want to be cancelled might lead you towards the premise of Let it Crash. There are a million and one ways that the system might fail during activity, and for most of them, the right thing to do is restart, pick up the pieces, and go forward from there if you can. You&#x27;re going to have to handle that anyway in case of unexpected restarts due to hardware or software faults.<p>&gt; A boot request is sent to a controller to boot up a processor returning a termination report. A run request is sent to code to run returning a value.<p>What do you mean by a processor here. Like a separate CPU, or is this a process &#x2F; thread?<p>What is the relationship between this processor and the code, and the run request? What behavior is changing in this example?<p>&gt; Because tail calls with state variables do not always work and Erlang does not have an assignment command, Erlang programs often use helper processes to temporarily hold state.<p>That Erlang programs often use processes to hold state is not a deficiency; that&#x27;s how Erlang models the world. State is intended to be held in processes, and the way that they do that is through tail call recursion on the explicit state. Although, sometimes, some state is stored in the process dictionary (which is essentially a key-value store) or in ETS&#x2F;Mnesia, which can be modeled as a process (but is implemented as shared memory), or in state held outside of Erlang (such as the filesystem, or other programs).<p>If you don&#x27;t like the world model where state is held in processes, Erlang clearly isn&#x27;t for you; but I find it&#x27;s a model that fits well with distributed systems, and allows for complex systems to be built with small teams.",13.62,22418195

otakucode,"&gt;also offers a glimpse into a potential future where companies of all sorts, not just auto insurers<p>No, not companies of &quot;all&quot; sorts.  Just insurance companies.  Other companies are regulated by Congress as part of antitrust regulations which would prevent them from doing this kind of thing.  Insurance companies, however, are not regulated by antitrust laws.  Insurance is declared to be &quot;not commerce&quot; and therefore not answerable to antitrust laws.  They are permitted to break any antitrust law they please.  This is why medical insurance companies, for instance, hold national meetings every few years to decide what price they are willing to pay for medical goods and services.  This is price-fixing, and it is illegal in absolutely any industry - except insurance.  In insurance, they can do it publicly because there literally is no law against it.  There&#x27;s a law PROTECTING it.  It was called the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  The plan was to repeal it as part of the Affordable Care Act.  It was the clause that enabled the ACA to survive the entire revision process... and was then promptly removed from the bill immediately before its passage.  This is why the insurers have never really fought very hard against the ACA.  If it ever gets repealed, the McCarran-Ferguson act, that is, insurance companies will fall under antitrust regulation and have to change almost every business practice they follow.  They will have to compete against one another on price, compete against each other on what prices they pay, etc.  It would destroy their profit margins and probably result in the majority of them going out of business quite quickly.  Don&#x27;t hold your breath.  It&#x27;s why the insurance industry spends so much on lobbying and every lobbyist for every single industry will fight its repeal.  In other words, it will NEVER happen.  The law has been in place since 1945.",58.59,22418360

Spellman,"I break the tiers down into 3 categories.<p>1) Literacy. Can you move and shoot in the FPS? Know how pieces move in chess? Basics of the <i>how</i> to play. You must master these and make them reflexive to move forward.<p>2) Fundamentals. The emergent gameplay that arises from those basic rules. But importantly these are all contained <i>within</i> the game. I usually break these up into Tactics and Strategy. Tactics are the moment-to-moment events. Strategy are longer-term goals that help guide you towards victory, and understanding how overlapping or even conflicting strategies can work in synergy and in trade-offs.<p>For example, in chess tactics are things like recognizing forks and skewers. Strategy involves &quot;controlling the center&quot; or &quot;develop your pieces to good squares.&quot;<p>In MOBAs, last hitting, skill combos, space control are the tactics. Strategy can involve knowing when to push, when to group to gank vs split push, or farm vs gank decisions.<p>Interestingly some game types have more tactics&#x2F;strategy components. Twitch FPS games tend to be almost all tactics with a bit of strategy (gun X better in situation Y). Starcraft rewards strategy more heavily (do better macro!).<p>These are, as you mention, skills that will apply to the vast majority of games because they are baked into the rules of the game.<p>3) The Meta. Once you are near the Fundamentals skill cap, you can use information outside of the game to get an edge against similar opponents. I&#x27;m about to play player X, and they usually like to do Y, so I should prepare a counter strategy Z. A lot of players seem to really like character A because of these advantages, perhaps I should learn A and how to counter the most common tactics using my character&#x27;s skillset.<p>Note knowing the Meta also helps prune what information (Fundamentals) you need to learn and maintain. If no one plays character Foo, then you (probably) don&#x27;t need to understand their kit as intimately. But then someone could use it as an off-meta pick to surprise you!

zackmorris,"This article resonated with me. Being homeless is far, far more difficult than being part of the rat race. What it comes down to is, people feel that they suffer an indignity that someone would dare risk everything to be free rather than be conscripted to an employer. It threatens their entire religious heteronormative worldview that life is about pulling the yoke to provide for one&#x27;s children. If they have to suffer, then everyone else should too. Why should that guy get out of working when I have to get up at 6 am tomorrow? And so on and so forth.<p>Since wealth inequality is so extreme now globally, all labor slides into full-time and overtime. Some people look at the risk-reward value proposition of that, and correctly opt out. We label them homeless. But personally, I think of them as starving artists, freedom fighters and probably gifted. Some of the most dynamic people that I have ever met were on drugs, suffering with some form of mental illness like PTSD&#x2F;ADHD&#x2F;manic-depressive or one step away from living on the streets. Luckily they became computer programmers.<p>To a first-order approximation, homelessness is a measure of how authoritarian a society is. The choices are the $100k+ career at 40+ hours per week, menial labor at 50-60 hours per week, or homelessness. We pretend that there are 20 hour per week jobs that pay enough to launch a business, but of course that&#x27;s all make-believe. It&#x27;s not really even possible to work every other year, or have two people apply to the same job so they can alternate shifts. Systems of control lock us down by rents and medical bills and debts to the point that anything short of indentured servitude is not sustainable.<p>I&#x27;m seeing that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to live off the grid in a medium-sized city in the northwest where people actively work to ban city camping and prevent giving tiny homes to the homeless. Surely it must be impossible in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles. So I dunno, after a lot of trying to create some kind of free life for myself, after 20 years of struggle and poverty, I might just have to throw in the towel and get a job at a major corporation. I might be a slave then, but at least the system would provide for my basic needs.<p>This isn&#x27;t the future I signed up for, and more and more every day I am coming to terms with the fact that the American Dream is probably dead. I&#x27;ve found the Office Space&#x2F;Fight Club&#x2F;Mr. Robot portrayal of the working world to be uncannily accurate. I actually enjoy earning a paycheck and working with people as it happens, but when burnout sets in and I finally find myself unemployed again, the 6 months of living expenses that I&#x27;ve saved after years of lost life doesn&#x27;t feel like much of a consolation prize. The people who have it figured out are the sociopaths, able to skim income from other people&#x27;s labor and rationalize it by calling it capitalism. But there is no future in hard work. And lately, no market for it either.<p>This is a garbage comment and I&#x27;m not sure I even believe half of it, but it felt real in the moment so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and just post it.<p>EDIT: In the spirit of offering solutions rather than dwelling on problems, I think that an answer can be found in the gig economy, sustainability and expanded consciousness. Maker communities with urban gardens and such might have enough strength in numbers to provide basic needs between the extremes of homelessness and the 9-5 job. I&#x27;m trying to move in that direction but the forces that be don&#x27;t make it easy.",77.13,22418990
cogman10,"And, to be clear, people could still do bad stuff with compromised WASM.<p>The big difference is that the WASM sandbox significantly reduces the surface area of what bad stuff can be done.<p>Today, a compromise in the browser means the attacker can do whatever the browser can do (which is usually a LOT).  With the sandbox, a compromise can only really affect what the sandbox has available to it.  That means, if your sandbox only exposes a single method which takes in a string and returns a string, the worst thing an attacker can do is return a malformed string.<p>Of course, if you mishandle that returned string then bad stuff will happen but it&#x27;s a far cry from the input string being able to potentially cause arbitrary code execution which installs a virus on your machine.<p>To really do something evil you have to not only compromise the code running in WASM, you have to find a way to break out of WASM.

DoreenMichele,"The problem with clothing is that maintaining a middle class appearance essentially requires a middle class life.<p>My mother&#x27;s mother came from a low level German noble family. My mother sews beautifully and clothes was a very big deal for most of my life. I spent some time wishing I could be an image consultant or fashion model. I still fantasize about starting my own clothing line and I recently took over r&#x2F;ClothingStartups.<p>That background helped me pass for normal while homeless. I am capable of picking out clothes that work for me without trying them on. I was often mistaken for a tourist because I was clean and dressed casually.<p>But the kind of fit and social signaling and cleanliness you have in mind more or less requires housing. In practical terms, homeless people don&#x27;t have the means to store clean clothes, change into a clean outfit daily, etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t wash my clothes. I wore it for a week or three, acquired a new outfit, tried to shower if possible and threw the old outfit in the trash.<p>I didn&#x27;t typically carry spare clothes. I typically only had the clothes on my back.<p>I&#x27;ve been back in housing for over two years. I still largely handle it the same way.<p>I&#x27;m in a hundred year old SRO. There is one washer and dryer for the whole building and it isn&#x27;t especially clean and that&#x27;s not a solvable problem because of the tenants in the building. There is one laundromat that I know of in town and it has limited hours. I&#x27;m not currently in a position to hand wash and hang dry my items.<p>I am still &quot;under housed&quot; and don&#x27;t have my own kitchen and my fridge is currently dead and so forth. By some definitions, I would still be classified as &quot;homeless&quot;, though it&#x27;s vastly better than sleeping in a tent and I&#x27;ve always wanted to live in an SRO and it&#x27;s been overall a terrific experience. Still, to have a normal job and dress like a normal middle class person for it would be challenging in my current circumstances.<p>I&#x27;m in the process of trying to remedy some of the issues with my unit. I&#x27;m waiting on my tax refund and when I get it I expect to replace the fridge, among other things. (Management offered me a used fridge, but I have a compromised immune system. It&#x27;s not clean enough for my needs. They don&#x27;t charge enough rent to cover luxuries like new fridges.)<p>Anyway, I do think about things like the hygiene issue. I wrote a piece about wanting to encourage hotel stays to help homeless people access showers more consistently.<p>But I really think we need to do things like bring back SROs and Missing Middle housing. Some things really can&#x27;t be fixed while you are still unhoused. Trying to stay presentable in a &quot;middle class person with a regular job&quot; way is very challenging.

opo,"This quote is brought up often but it should be taken with some skepticism.   As user GatorD42 pointed out when this was brought up before:<p>&gt;...Baum claims Ehrlichman said that to him in 1994 while he was researching for a book he published in 1996 about the drug war. He didn&#x27;t include the quote in that book, but instead published it in 2012 and again in 2016, after Ehrlichman had died (in 1999).<p>This is a very explosive quote - if Baum had included it in his book in 1996 I am sure it would have garnered a huge amount of attention for the book. Instead Baum did not include it in his book, but instead would wait for decades later when Ehrlichman was no longer around to dispute the quote.<p>At any rate, if the quote was actually said by Ehrlichman, it isn&#x27;t a very accurate description of the drug polices of the Nixon administration. While Nixon is remembered for &quot;war on drugs&quot; rhetoric, the actual substance of his policies seem to be different than what people think it was:<p>&gt;...I have been fortunate over the years to discuss the distorted memory of Nixon&#x27;s drug policies with almost all of his key advisors as well as with historians. Their consensus is that because he was dramatically expanding the U.S. treatment system (by 350% in just 18 months!) and cutting criminal penalties, he had to reassure his right wing that he hadn’t gone soft. So he laid on some of the toughest anti-drug rhetoric in history, including making a White House speech declaring a “war on drugs” and calling drugs “public enemy number one”. It worked so well as cover that many people remember that “tough” press event and forget that what Nixon did at it was introduce not a general or a cop or a preacher to be his drug policy chief but…a medical doctor (Jerry Jaffe, a sweet, bookish man who had longish hair and sideburns and often wore the Mickey Mouse tie his kids had given him).<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samefacts.com&#x2F;who-started-the-war-on-drugs&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samefacts.com&#x2F;who-started-the-war-on-drugs&#x2F;</a><p>&gt;...&quot;Enforcement must be coupled with a rational approach to the reclamation of the drug user himself,&quot; Nixon told Congress in 1971. &quot;We must rehabilitate the drug user if we are to eliminate drug abuse and all the antisocial activities that flow from drug abuse.&quot;
&gt;The numbers back this up. According to the federal government&#x27;s budget numbers for anti-drug programs, the &quot;demand&quot; side of the war on drugs (treatment, education, and prevention) consistently got more funding during Nixon&#x27;s time in office (1969 to 1974) than the &quot;supply&quot; side (law enforcement and interdiction).<p>&gt;Historically, this is a commitment for treating drugs as a public health issue that the federal government has not replicated since the 1970s. (Although President Barack Obama&#x27;s budget proposal would, for the first time in decades, put a majority of anti-drug spending on the demand side once again.) ...<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;29&#x2F;11325750&#x2F;nixon-war-on-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;29&#x2F;11325750&#x2F;nixon-war-on-drugs</a>",83.38,22419053

bhupy,"&gt; Market prices are currently set based on 1-3x multipliers of Medicare reimbursement, so by definition the government already handles health care at lower costs.<p>I work in insurance, and I can tell you right now that $25 for a cleaning (per this article) is significantly lower than the amount for a cleaning (procedure code D1110) set by Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid. You can look it up yourself by visiting the FAIR Health code lookup tool (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairhealthconsumer.org&#x2F;dental&#x2F;results"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairhealthconsumer.org&#x2F;dental&#x2F;results</a>), and setting the ZIP code to that of Carlton, GA (location of the Wal-Mart clinic), 30627. The average allowed amount is $64.<p>&gt; Commodifying health care has proven to be disastrous in the US because it&#x27;s, in practice, impossible to &quot;shop around&quot; — not even including cases where the &quot;customer&quot; is unconscious or in a life-threatening situation where &quot;shopping&quot; would be ridiculous, the profit models of health care centers are forcing many to close, leaving people with few choices in their immediate area, exacerbated by the &quot;network&quot; coverage model of insurance companies where you may not even be able to go to certain hospitals or doctor&#x27;s offices.<p>Ignoring emergency health services (which is the minority of health spending), I&#x27;m not sure that we have enough information to irrefutably prove that preventable and planned care cannot be successfully commodified. A common theory around why we haven&#x27;t been able to commodify healthcare in the US is due to a lack of price transparency, and the fact that employer sponsored health insurance removes the price sensitivity from buyers[1][2].<p>&gt; Interestingly, though, improvements in supply chain management are making it possible to centrally-plan commodities like clothing. Multinational companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon are doing this already, in fact.<p>They aren&#x27;t centrally planned, though — they are subject to market competition (see: DHL, UPS, FedEx, FlexPort, Maersk, etc). Their ability to be major &quot;central planners&quot; by controlling large parts of the supply chain is predicated on their ability to fend off market competition, and the moment they fail to do that, this manifests as a market opportunity for new competitors to take their place, wherever in the supply chain the large corporations fall short.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econtalk.org&#x2F;keith-smith-on-free-market-health-care&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econtalk.org&#x2F;keith-smith-on-free-market-health-c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kfor.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;okc-hospital-posting-surgery-prices-online&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kfor.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;okc-hospital-posting-surgery-prices-on...</a>",5.16,22419344

sunnydayddr,"This has direct implications in head-to-head games.<p>In fighting games, this observation leads to the following advice for someone playing against an opponent with weaker fundamentals: &quot;play it safe until you give them enough rope to hang themselves.&quot;<p>Instead of going in as aggressively as normally would be required against a skilled opponent, just sit there and defend, and give your opponent free reign to try to crack your defense. The more they try, the more chances they give themselves to slip up and make a big mistake, which you then take full advantage of.<p>If their execution is worse than your defense, this is seen as a less risky strategy than going in on the offensive and hoping you don&#x27;t make a mistake yourself.<p>Also applies to chess in the same way. Weaker opponents tend to accidentally &quot;hang&quot; their pieces a lot (i.e. move their pieces directly under attack of your pieces) just by poor observation, so it can be a good strategy to just stall, keep to your side of the board, and wait until your opponent slips up and makes a crucial mistake.

My takeaway from this (which was the same argument I made back when we were failing at producing anything even usable let alone reliable) is: It needs to be someone&#x27;s sole goal and I&#x27;ll go a step further and say they should be on the outside of the team developing the main app. Being too close to the underlying code makes for a bad QA&#x2F;Automated Tester IMHO.

If the data is relevant and was collected properly then it can be a goldmine, regardless of the theoretical explanation given by the researchers.

Sure they put a few members of a gang away, those left soon rebuild and seen this happen so many times it is beyond painful to see this play out time and time again.<p>Then you have the rehab failings that equally do not help users get clean, this see&#x27;s the NHS suffer and numerous services abused as they are just too soft.

Many don&#x27;t and will often only go thru the motions to appease some judge and with that, they are great at gaming the system.<p>Now, if they would legalise the less dangerous drugs like canabis in the UK and tax that, then they could use that money to finance education, and more so proper rehab.<p>Equally, poor area&#x27;s, they are and always will be the source of driving people towards drugs and that&#x27;s because their reality is just depressing, this see&#x27;s such area&#x27;s often become drugs hotbeds.<p>But sadist part is the police depend upon information from the public, alas been so many instances in which that is misused and ignored to the extent that anybody informing is soon known by those gangs and users and they resort to making false reports to the police and I&#x27;ve seen many good honest people in my area driven away and suffer.

That is very much prevalent within the police and again - all based upon experience.  So you end up with a system that tackles the effect and not the root cause of what is responsible for the bulk of crime we see on the streets.<p>So in effect to fix the prisons - they need to fix the reasons why people are in those prisons.<p>But yes - rehab needs to happen, but equally it needs to be done right and properly - if they can&#x27;t do that right in prisons, then they have no hope in society and that is exactly how it is alas.",54.23,22420246

tialaramex,"&gt; Look at what has happened with misbehaving CAs.<p>OK. Perhaps you have some examples in mind?<p>&gt; The responses have ranged between nothing and removing them 5 years later.<p>Certainly you&#x27;ve got an example of &quot;nothing&quot; and of &quot;removing them 5 years later&quot; to start with, right?<p>DigiNotar is the most obvious example of a &quot;misbehaving CA&quot; that you might be concerned about. In June 2011 their services were broken into and they decided not to tell anybody. There were no technologies in place at that time which could detect problems like this without DigiNotar&#x27;s assistance. At the end of August a google.com certificate issued this way was used to attack Iranian web users, but Google&#x27;s Chrome browser had pinning protection (only for Google&#x27;s own services) and so at this point it detected the attack in progress.<p>Mozilla shipped updated Firefox versions which distrusted DigiNotar&#x27;s public root in about 48 hours (not &quot;5 years&quot;) and over subsequent days distrusted the entire DigiNotar hierarchy including those parts the Dutch national government had insisted were fine (they were not fine).<p>The public reactions at the time mirror your incredulity by the way, people who grep&#x27;d their newly updated Firefox and discovered DigiNotar&#x27;s CA certificate (in fact blacklisted explicitly) as &quot;proof&quot; of a conspiracy by Mozilla to send all their traffic to some scary foreign company.<p>Perhaps DigiNotar just isn&#x27;t recent enough for you. So let&#x27;s look at rather smaller deviations from the more recent past. In 2015 WoSign (a QiHoo 360 company which operated a CA) acquired the Israeli CA StartCom in secret. No significant countries have any mechanism in place to detect this (a potentially hostile acquisition of a private company) and so the browser vendors had no idea until mid-2016.<p>Not telling Mozilla about this was already a violation of both agreements (for WoSign and for StartCom). But in 2016 WoSign&#x2F; StartCom (now one shared controlling mind) minted new certificates using SHA-1 signatures for several outfits, notably an Australian financial services company named Tyro. Since new SHA-1 certificates were prohibited in browsers in 2016 these certificates were back-dated to appear they&#x27;d been issued in 2015, another violation of the rules. The Tyro cert was probably actually issued in June 2016.<p>After conducting an investigation which included having Israeli documents assessed by a Hebrew-speaking lawyer and a bunch of digital forensics work, by September of that year Mozilla was instituting partial distrust of WoSign and StartCom, and in 2017 the browser distrusted them entirely. Other vendors followed suit (very belatedly in the case of Microsoft).",40.19,22421052

Java has them, and it can even serialize objects with behavior.<p>I think you&#x27;re thinking of a very shallow kind of auto-generation of code, which doesn&#x27;t include any kind of behavior beyond calling your API.<p>The GP though was talking about generating the behavior based on the type specification, which is also doable in principle. For example, you could provide a complex type specification for a sorting function, and have the compiler infer the implementation.<p>For example, you could declare a function which takes a list of `Ord a` and returns a list of `Ord a` such that the second list is a permutation of the first list and each element in the second list is &lt;= to the next element (you of course need dependent types for this). With this type signature, the system could generate the code for a function which achieves this purpose.<p>However, I do not believe that it will be easier to write that type signature (especially if you want to add properties like stability or time and space constraints) than it would be to write the actual sorting function yourself and sticking with `Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]`.

Hiring too quickly tends to not apply good due-diligence because the few staff who are demonstrably good at hiring will be spread too thin to have an impact.

Moreover, the forensic examination of a condom submitted as evidence, supposedly worn and torn during intercourse with Assange, revealed no DNA whatsoever — neither his, nor hers, nor anybody else’s.

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether Assange is guilty of the alleged crimes the US has come up with or not, what matters is whether he is expected to receive a fair trial in the US and whether the potential sentences in the US would be roughly on a par with what he&#x27;d expect for the same alleged crimes in the UK. For all I can see, this is definitely not the case.<p>You can even make a case that almost nobody should be extradited to the US by any country, since the US justice system has serious flaws, might not be just at all (e.g. it has about 10 times longer maximum prison sentences than in the rest of the civilized world) and the US penal system constitutes a constant human rights violation. For example, the administrations of many US prisons are notoriously unable to prevent the raping and murdering of their inmates. I&#x27;ve even heard people from the US making jokes about prison rape, as if that was to be expected and part of the &quot;justice&quot;. As another example, a prison in Illinois was under 23 years of permanent lockdown, meaning that all inmates were in isolation for 23 years. There are credible accounts that Assange is facing imprisonment in high-security isolation facilities similar to what they did to Manning for a long time. I cannot understand why any civilized person would allow a treatment as inhumane as in US maximum security prisons with isolation, regardless of the crime.<p>Generally speaking, countries should review their extradition treaties.

jillesvangurp,"Nuclear is not going to happen in time and other technologies that are completely uncontroversial are already running circles around it for the past decade in terms of cost and growth (which would be negative for nuclear). I don&#x27;t expect meaningful results to come from nuclear investments in the next decades. This would be the same period of time most modern countries will cross the 50-100% covered by renewable energy mark. Much of the current deployed nuclear capacity might actually end up being retired in the same period because most of it is already on the edge of it&#x27;s economic life and replacements are controversial from a cost perspective (never mind the safety). The status quo is that nuclear plants are multi billion $ projects that take decades to plan and realize and that have very dubious economics.<p>100% renewable everywhere is not going to happen everywhere in the next two decades; but there are plenty of countries shooting for that on a 15-20 year time line. In 20 years, most of the remaining countries will be actively planning to catch up in a hurry or simply end up importing excess energy from more clued in places at a premium. Even approved plans for nuclear plants (of which there are preciously few) would probably take longer to realize; and lets face it, mostly these plans reside in some drawer gathering dust.<p>Nuclear is not a solution short term (&lt; 20 years) or mid term (&lt; 40 years) and long term (&gt;40 years) it will have to be cost competitive with vastly cheaper than today renewables. Which is a different way of saying the winter olympics will be organized in hell regularly.<p>Nuclear security alone makes it a non starter from a cost point of view. Any nuclear reactor requires 24x7 security to prevent people from depopulating their local area with a bit of explosives. Micro reactors make excellent dirty bombs and with tens of thousands of them around it&#x27;s more a question of when than if somebody manages to do this. The resulting security requirements alone makes them impractical, even if they would be able to compete with the renewable solutions that will be common in a few decades. These are likely to be vastly cheaper than what we have today. The main question is how many orders of magnitude cheaper things can get before people stop caring about the price. Below a certain price, using excess renewable energy to synthesize all sorts of fuels will also become vastly cheaper than refining oil no matter how inefficient that is from an energy point of view (and it&#x27;s actually not that bad). Ironically, refining oil requires a lot of energy, which comes from ... renewables. That&#x27;s why Texas leads everyone else with solar and wind deployments.",27.32,22423151

This is all very easy and provides infinite interchangeability; there would be no change in cert provisioning necessary if I switched to Nginx or HAProxy.<p>But, most people don&#x27;t have a setup that supports something like this, so they really need the all-in-one thing or they&#x27;re just going to say &quot;we don&#x27;t really need TLS&quot;.

danial,"If you are hand-managing VPCs then there is every chance that this additional layer of complexity will lead to mistakes. You could argue that the increase in cognitive load of managing them can offset the benefits of an additional defense-in-depth control. New developers joining the team are likely to make mistakes and this is the sort of thing that doesn&#x27;t get caught in code reviews either.<p>However, VPC configurations are an essential defense-in-depth that can be programmatically managed. AWS-managed VPCs are certainly not hand managed.<p>While maintaining Cloudformation or Terraform templates is still a pain, the good news is that it is becoming increasingly easier via frameworks like AWS CDK. This allows your deployment code to programatically generate the infrastructure and VPC configuration. This decreases the likelihood of mistakes made in configuration and increases the chances of such mistakes being caught during code reviews.",12.8,22425191

It is also used despite many developed countries or regions not being Western (e.g. Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao), and therefore left out when &quot;Western world&quot; is used to denote developed countries. Privatization policies (involving government enterprises and public services) and multinational corporations are often considered a visible sign of Western nations&#x27;s economic presence, especially in Third World countries, and represent common institutional environment for powerful politicians, enterprises, trade unions and firms, bankers and thinkers of the Western world.<p>-----&gt;8-----<p>So, &quot;Western&quot; is often used interchangably with first world; Countries in the first world, also according to wikipedia:<p>-----8&lt;-----<p>Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<p>The Western-aligned countries included:<p>Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan<p>The neutral countries included:<p>Austria, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, and (now former) Yugoslavia.<p>-----&gt;8-----<p>This is because &quot;First world&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Western&quot; has roots in the cold war.<p>&quot;Second world&quot; == Soviet bloc<p>&quot;Third world&quot; == everywhere else.

Resources in this subnet will have all internet traffic routed through the NAT gateway, preventing direct access from the internet, just like your home router is a buffer for your PC.<p>You can get creative here. Adding a subnet 10.0.16.0&#x2F;20 will give you ~4096 addresses, which is useful for lambdas that need to scale horizontally (each one consumes a private IP address). Also, if your lambdas need internet access, to call an API for example, you <i>must</i> route traffic through a NAT gateway.<p>It may seem like a lot to setup, but once you have it up and running, you save yourself a lot of headache in the long run.

layoric,"&gt; Renewables are also extremely limited in practical use.<p>From my experience, they are a lot less limited than people realize. The UK&#x27;s use of wind is a good example [0], studies have been done in Australia where we previously thought the upper limit of renewables would be 20% of power generation only 10 years ago, each yeah they are revising this number upwards thanks to technology developments. South Australia is a good example here too [1].<p>Just because we can&#x27;t easily foresee a solution that is 100% renewable&#x2F;carbon free energy generation _right now_, doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t head in that direction. Waiting around for a perfect solution and sitting on our hands is exactly what we shouldn&#x27;t be doing.<p>Also in regards to your comments for individual behaviors impacting the planet, turns out people can walk and chew gum at the same time. I&#x27;m vegan, avoid flying (haven&#x27;t flown in &gt;5 years), work remote and have solar panels on my house. Making personal changes like you and I (and many others and growing) have done absolutely makes a difference, but so does the technology development. For example<p>&gt; With sun and wind you can only implement it so far before you hit a wall, the wall being the need for huge amounts of grid storage to serve dark&#x2F;not windy times.<p>I work mainly in the solar radiation forecasting area, basically thickness of clouds forecasts. Something that the _tech_ we&#x27;ve developed performs really well at is forecasting the next 4 hours, updating every 5-15 minutes thanks to the amazing tech that is the latest generation of geostationary weather satellites. As you likely know, one of the important properties of an electricity grid is stability which the intermittent nature of renewables like solar don&#x27;t excel (as you&#x27;ve pointed out) at especially if you live anywhere there are commonly clouds. One way to improve stability is to smooth out the variability and to know ahead of time how much the power output is going to change. You might think this is just a 1-2% improvement but actually this is impacts _how much_ solar power generation to can add to an electricity grid by a lot and it also GREATLY reduces the size of battery required to get that smoothing of power generation. Does it get us to 100% renewable energy generation? No, but it lets us rush for higher penetration whilst maintaining stability in electricity networks, which helps generators make money, which makes investment look more attractive, which builds more solar, you see the cycle.<p>So yes, you can only implement them so far, but how far this can be taken is generally rising in many countries, and getting there quickly is important.<p>Yes, if everyone made the individual choices today, the world could drop our CO2 emissions very quickly in a short period of time. Social problems are hard and sadly we have leaders without the political will to go against their own personal self interest and that of their large emitter donors [2]. So while some lobby to try and change this, others try to encourage those with money from their large emissions to put their money somewhere else that will reduce emissions by making it more profitable. A carrot AND a stick as it were. It isn&#x27;t just &quot;hopeium&quot;, people in these fields are working their butts off and the inertia is building, it&#x27;s not going to be easy so yes I think the future is bright _for the climate tech industry_ as there are positive contributions to be made.

We describe a design that focuses entirely on passcode self-escrow(i.e., storing a copy of the user passcode into a write-only component on the device) and thus does not require any changes to underlying cryptographic algorithms. Further, by predicating any lawful access on extended-duration physical seizure, we foreclose mass-surveillance use cases while still supporting reasonable investigatory interests. Moreover, by couching per-device authorization protocols with the device manufacturer, this design avoids creating new trusted authorities or organizations while providing particularity (i.e., no “master keys” exist). Finally, by providing a concrete description of one such approach, we hope to encourage further technical consideration of the possibilities and limitations of trade-offs in this design space.",7.72,22426481

While we definitely have customers that use our WiFi products in a production capacity, generally our customers use our WiFi portfolio to prototype in their offices and then migrate to a cellular module for their end product.  Saves cost and complexity when you just want to get something working, and our DeviceOS allows you to use the same or similar publish APIs regardless of the underlying connectivity technology.<p>When you purchase one of our modules, you are buying into a proven and tested platform that is guaranteed to work with our cloud.

doctoring,"This article brings up a specific inflammation-related protein (HMGB1) as being correlated with cognitive impairment after an ICU stay.<p>Usually an ICU stay is the result of being profoundly and dangerously ill -- going to the ICU likely means that you need significant pharmacological and&#x2F;or mechanical assistance in the basic things like... circulating blood. Or oxygenation. And once there, you may have tubes&#x2F;catheters&#x2F;wires in various orifices and puncturing vessels and organs. You&#x27;re often medically sedated, and if you become too awake or agitated, you are sedated further. Unsurprisingly, many patients become agitated or delirious -- they don&#x27;t know where they are or when it is or maybe even who they are. Which makes things worse. I mean, imagine it -- maybe you wake up in the midst of this horrendous state of affairs, and you become understandably upset and confused, but if you move around or holler (if you can) you may well get further sedated. Repeatedly. The cognitive impact of this alone can understandably be immense.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to say that ICUs are some evil thing, though surely they could be improved. But the causes of &quot;post-intensive care syndrome&quot; are undoubtedly enormously multi-factorial, what with the level of derangement and insult to your body (and especially your mind!) from whatever illness led to you the ICU to begin with, and the experience of being there. And as such I am skeptical that this single protein could be terrifically useful either as a marker of or a therapeutic target for cognitive impairment in this setting.<p>(I think as protein mass spec and other technologies improve, we might gain a better understanding of how sets of dozens or hundreds of proteins in the body may be related to disease states, and perhaps therapies will target combinations of proteins or more complex interactions rather than &quot;blocks this one protein&quot;.)",61.24,22426835

FiatLuxDave,"Former fusion startup founder here.  This is a very good point.  My startup took 6 years to fail and much of our competition at the time is still at it 20 years later.<p>There are a number of things which are also impedance mismatches between the typical SV startup mode and hard startups.  One of these is the failure path.  When an adtech startup fails, the founders just go get well-paying jobs at a FAANG, or at least that what the perception appears to be.  When your fusion startup goes bust, you... get evicted and live in your car for a while.  There&#x27;s no on-ramp for failed founders back into the industry.  Heck, if its a hard startup, there may be no industry yet to go back to. So, you have to go find something else to do to pay the bills.  The personal cost of failure can be much higher than typical startups.  &quot;Our incredible journey&quot; for hard startups is more like, &quot;Well, none of us died&quot;.<p>Another thing which doesn&#x27;t mix well between the typical SV expectations and hard startups is that all the things which VCs think are advantages to being located in SV are generally disadvantages to people working on hard problems.  Doing web software with ads?  Lots of people to recruit in the Valley.  Doing nuclear fusion... is there anyone doing nuclear fusion in the Valley?  How do they afford to live when competing with all that cheap ad money?  Perhaps I should locate on Madison Avenue, it has the same &quot;advantages&quot;.<p>Then there is the typical way that VCs filter, starting with step one, &quot;Know someone who can introduce you&quot;.  That&#x27;s a lot easier when you are in the same location, working in similar industries.  It&#x27;s a poor filter when most of the people working on a problem live far away, doing stuff very different from everyone you know.  There are far fewer serial entrepreneurs when the failure time is measured in decades, so networking is more difficult.<p>I&#x27;m happy to see VCs try to return to working on hard problems.  The Valley used to be good at that, before they became a center of the advertising industry.  But Valley VCs need to read their history.  In the late 1950s&#x2F;early 1960s, New York was the center of finance and advertising.  The idea that somewhere out in the wilds of California would become a center of a new industry with its own finance ecosystem was crazy.  But everyone in the early Valley knew what those East Coast people were like.  The Valley is now the new East Coast people, the new Madison Avenue.  Doing a hard startup in the Valley now is like trying to start Intel in 1960 New York.  Hard startups are hard enough, without trying to do that.",75.84,22427397

That is his right, and he was given assurances it would be granted. But that same evening, everything was in the newspapers again.

luketheobscure,"Tailwind is fantastic. Everyone goes through the initial shock of complaining about the &quot;ugly markup&quot;, the violation of separation of concerns, etc. But I&#x27;ve worked in enough large codebases to tell you that the ones that use Tailwind have a more consistent UI, with much less handwritten CSS. Bootstrap sites inevitably devolve into a soup of custom CSS and Bootstrap framework. You end up with lots of verbose class declarations like &quot;btn btn-link btn-primary btn-xs danger&quot;, but you still need lots of little `margin-left: 3px` rules to push and pull things into place. Most other CSS libraries suffer the same fate.<p>On the other side of things, sites without a framework generally opt for a convention like &quot;BEM&quot; (block-element-modifier). BEM seems to be the worst of both worlds, both abandoning the &quot;cascading&quot; part of &quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot; and still requiring verbose class names!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a Tailwind project for the last six months with a team of around 8 people. We did a bunch of initial work getting the Tailwind config just right and some base styling in place, but since then we&#x27;ve barely written a line of CSS. Yes, the templates are verbose, but they are also incredibly readable and easy to reason about what classes are doing what. On-ramping new people has been easy as well, since they don&#x27;t have to learn some custom system, instead they can just read the docs on the Tailwind site.",25,22429231

bscphil,"I think you might be over-stating, not the strength of Le Guin&#x27;s criticism, but the degree to which the community of Anarres fails to reject coercive power structures.<p>Part of what is so interesting about Anarres is that even when power is built up in institutions, it is not hierarchical power. Individuals build power primarily through their capacity for influencing others. Those who are older and more accomplished therefore have more of this kind of power, and younger people like Shevek have less. It&#x27;s interesting, though, that the people of Anarres seem uniquely positioned to take note of and resist the growth of these power structures. Shevek, in whose point of view the book is largely written, constantly takes note of them, and the people of Anarres form groups dedicated to reform in response.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that even the power built up in institutions lacks the capacity for organized violence. Even though the protagonist is &quot;on the wrong side of&quot; the institutional power in Anarres, nothing very bad happens to him as a result. When Shevek violates the central &quot;law&quot; of the land by trying to leave Anarres, no institutional power stops him, only a small spontaneous <i>mob</i> of protesters make the attempt. Le Guin says of them &quot;they had no experience in being [a mob]. Members of a community, not elements of a collectivity, they were not moved by mass feeling; there were as many emotions there as there were people ... Their inexperience saved the passenger&#x27;s life.&quot;<p>You mention the case of the playwright, Tirin. But his case is interesting because he clearly struggles to fit into an egalitarian society, and might actually be (or become) mentally ill. As Shevek&#x27;s childhood friend, it was <i>his</i> idea to go about building a prison, and seems to take the most joy in putting someone in it. He&#x27;s the most sharply critical of Anarres society, &quot;a natural rebel&quot;, and this leads him into trouble we don&#x27;t quite know the extent of. It&#x27;s implied he&#x27;s either gone mad, or murdered someone, or raped them. (He was merely reprimanded publicly for the play, not sent directly to the asylum.) How people like this are to be treated is clearly meant to be a confusing grey area, and Le Guin wants us to think about it from a critical perspective.<p>Tirin left therapy after several years (the island he goes to is explicitly intended to be therapeutic, not a prison), and Shevek ends up concluding that he actually did go crazy, as a result of being a kind of social outcast. Shevek says that &quot;We have created crime, just as the propertarians did.&quot; But this kind of &quot;crime&quot; is clearly meant to be in contrast to what he later learns about criminality and class relations on Urras.<p>So it does seem as if Anarres has largely succeeded in curbing most institutional violence and hierarchical coercion. You&#x27;re right, however, that Le Guin remains sharply critical of the unfreedom that remains. I believe this book and <i>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas</i> suggest that she sees political struggle as a never-ending series of revolutionary actions towards a utopian ideal. The ideal cannot be achieved, of course, but so long as there are people who can see the ways in which their society fails, there will be people who try to do better.<p>Interestingly, though, this seems to further confirm the point I made in my top level comment. Le Guin does not take the detached point of view of some supposedly &quot;anthropological perspective&quot;, seeking to understand each society from within its own assumptions. Rather, she clearly thinks that at least some of the citizens of <i>both</i> societies are capable of grasping the same utopian ideal, and believes that Anarres is much closer to achieving it than Urras.",38.75,22429643

I know someone very closely who works in one of the big tech companies and I can tell you that he is wrapped in a very strange bubble. For example, he was 100% convinced that Trump will be impeached and booted out of office before his term completed. Now he has stopped talking about the impeachment altogether.

This worsening can present as recurrent fever 4 to 7 days after initial defervescence, new chest infiltrates, respiratory failure, or watery diarrhea. In a cohort of 75 patients in Hong Kong, 85% had recurrent symptoms after initial improvement. The authors described a triphasic course with fever, myalgia early in week 1, and recurrent fever, hypoxemia, diarrhea, and shifting chest infiltrates in week 2. Twenty percent of patients progressed to ARDS during the third week of the illness. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate in 14 patients with relapse showed peak viral loads occurred at day 10 after onset of symptoms, suggesting that the late deterioration may be due to the host immune response rather than to uncontrolled viral replication.<p>(Granted, the Japanese woman&#x27;s symptoms disappeared for almost a month before reappearing.)<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinicproceedings.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0025-6196(11)62689-X&#x2F;pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinicproceedings.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0025-6196(11)...</a>",71.84,22430764

rolleiflex,"I think you are right to be skeptical and I don&#x27;t claim to have an insight into how accurate it is. However, mind that while Turkey is culturally about 80% western and 20% non-western, it&#x27;s really unpredictable where that 20% shows up. For example, the reason the census count can be reasonably accurate even in the adversity of undocumented immigrants is that Turkish police can walk up to anybody they see as suspicious on the street and ask for their TCKN &#x2F; ID to do a spot check for arrest warrants — decidedly free of the need for the western concept of a &#x27;probable cause&#x27; or anything like that, it&#x27;s a member of your community asking to validate your ID. Since they have the readers attached to their mobile phones, the check takes a couple seconds.<p>This also, by design, makes it really hard to be undocumented in Turkey. There&#x27;s a significant skin tone difference between people from the Middle East and those in Istanbul, and the police does absolutely use this to be more scrutinous if you&#x27;re even just walking by them. From an US perspective this is discrimination, and it definitely is, but this is how it works — and they&#x27;re pretty good at spotting non-Turkish people. As a real example in action, there was a recent directive that required refugees to keep their residences within the borders of the first municipality they registered in (many of the Syrian refugees had moved to Istanbul from where they first registered for benefits), and the police managed to significantly clamp down on unregistered immigrants fairly quickly and send them back to the cities they registered to.<p>In this specific case this was the right move since the resources are allocated to states (<i>il</i>s) based on where refugees are registered and Istanbul alone does not have nearly the capacity to house that many refugees. My point is that Turkish police does have a lot more leeway than the US police before it becomes socially unacceptable — and while this is overall not a great thing (loose oversight), it also makes them much more effective at making a census in the right ballpark.",31.82,22431472

So far, building green infrastructure seems attractive, but I fear that in the end it just makes energy a little bit cheaper for people, and the real CO2 impact that happens in the transport and agriculture sectors doesn&#x27;t really get solved.<p>I also was attracted to planting trees, since there&#x27;s a very concrete impact there, that can&#x27;t really be cheated against (unless people burn them down of course). So I started calculating how many trees to plant and it turns out that there&#x27;s a lot of misleading info.<p>For example, in ideal conditions a tree might accumulate 20kg of CO2 in 40 years. My car did 16000km at about 1&#x2F;14, on gasoline so that&#x27;s 2742kg of CO2. So some website will tell me to plant 140 trees to compensate over 40 years, to compensate what I did in 1 year, assuming all those trees survive.<p>But they don&#x27;t, only 55% lives, so I should plant 280 trees to be a bit more sure I really am compensating. And then it&#x27;ll be compensated in 2060, which is useless because climate is changing now, not in 40 years. So it&#x27;s better to compensate up front, so say I want to make sure I&#x27;ve made an impact by 2025, I should plant 8 times as many trees, so that&#x27;s 2240 trees, and that&#x27;s just assuming they grow linearly, which they probably don&#x27;t do. And that they are planted in the tropics, which they probably aren&#x27;t, and even if they were there&#x27;s a risk they would be burned down for agriculture within the decade anyway.<p>And that&#x27;s just me with an under average commute driving a mediocre car.<p>Does anyone have a better solution for offsetting carbon?

icegreentea2,"There are a few reasons why this may not be a strong overreaction. The first is that since flu is always with us, we normalize the risk. This doesn&#x27;t mean that our chosen countermeasures and decisions for flu is actually correct or optimal, just that we&#x27;re for the moment comfortable with them. Just like how lots of young people don&#x27;t get the flu vaccine until after they actually get the flu.<p>So just because their current flu countermeasures don&#x27;t include the measures proposed doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not rational to consider them. Their prior actions could actually be irrational, and the context shift is just allowing them to adjust their perception and actions.<p>The second is that since WFH is an preventative measure designed to minimize the probability of COVID-19 reaching flu transmission rates, you can&#x27;t simply say that &quot;the current risk is low&quot;, you have to try to consider the likelyhood of risk significantly increasing without action.<p>Let&#x27;s be real here, even if COVID-19 was literally exactly a different flu, it would be still be a problem and we should be planning for it carefully. North American hospitals are cost conscious and therefore typically only have enough resources to just about cover a normal flu season spike. Doubling (say nothing about 10x) the amount the hospitalizations required would be an incredible stress to the system.",70.81,22434049

As the ULEZ is rolled out, there would be heavy subsidies offered for EVs for residents in that increasing zone. Before all of that though, all local bus operates would have a 5 year age limit on all busses and strict emissions standards enforced. Residents would have the ability to report back and host subsidized air quality sensors+data, there would be a portal to report offending bus routes (just like there are noise abatement reporting procedures set up for airfields). There would be a mass overhaul of the cycle lane network from Southall down to feltham through Hounslow towards Heathrow airport.<p>I would also heavily subsidize Piccadilly line travel for LHR employees and extend the LHR free travel zone for busses up to Hounslow West station &amp; Hayes and Harlington station (right now it&#x27;s only up to hatton cross and Holiday Inn - people still have to pay to get there and instead just opt to drive).<p>Enforcement of an LHR ULEZ would be at the end of a whole list of measures.

This is a serious question: if people don&#x27;t bother voting based on policies they want, then why is that even important?  If this theory of yours is true, then it really seems to call the voting population&#x27;s basic intelligence into question, not to mention the fundamental idea of democracy itself.  If the people are too utterly stupid to vote for their own best interests at least most of the time, then why wouldn&#x27;t authoritarianism be a better system?<p>Honestly, I find it easier to believe that the polls are bad.  I&#x27;ve seen way too many polls in my lifetime where the questions were manipulative, or just plain poorly worded or chosen.  On top of that, the other problem with polls is that they only capture results from people who actually bother to respond to the polls, or are in a place where the pollsters are.  Usually, when the latter is brought up, we&#x27;re supposed to somehow believe that the pollsters have some great methodology that lets them determine what a larger population wants just by sampling a much smaller number of people in that population, but this is completely subject to bias and error.  And finally, I point again to the 2016 election: predicting a winner is <i>not</i> as hard as asking if they want &lt;thing x&gt;.  In this case, the poll is asking <i>exactly</i> the same thing as the election itself will: who do you plan to vote for?    Asking about &lt;thing x&gt; is not as easy, because you can get wildly different results by asking the question differently.  Do I want &quot;Medicare for All&quot;?  Well, the answer might depend on many things, like how exactly it would be implemented.  Is private insurance still allowed to exist as a supplement or alternative?  Are non-citizens&#x2F;&quot;illegal aliens&quot;&#x2F;&quot;migrants&quot; (pick your term) covered? etc.  You would probably get very different answers depending on those points in a large poll in America, so if you just ask a simple &quot;do you want it? yes&#x2F;no&quot; question, that might not align at all with what actual candidates are proposing.  Asking &quot;who do you plan to vote for?&quot; avoids that.  And in the 2016 election, the polls were nowhere even close to the election results.

First, here is what Section 230 actually says:<p>&gt;<i>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</i><p>&gt;<i>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</i><p>Note there are no requirements for &quot;neutrality&quot;, or for perfection or any other such thing. &quot;Section 230 gives special protection on the assumption that platforms aren&#x27;t involved in selecting what users post&quot; is completely incorrect. A service that carries anything neutrally short of a lawful order is covered under <i>Common Carrier</i> status, which is a different thing. Before 230, Internet services faced two choices: to be perfectly neutral and engage in no moderation and thus not be responsible under common carrier, or else to engage in moderation, fail to be 100% perfect at it, and after inevitably having something bad posted get sued for it and end up being ruled the &quot;publisher or speaker&quot;. This would destroy all real time user content posting, and potentially user content posting in general.<p>The point of 230 was precisely to allow imperfect and biased moderation and content enforcement by real time (or close) private platforms <i>without</i> assuming legal responsibility for what users published. Quite arguably more than any other law in existence it&#x27;s what made the modern Internet possible.",51.06,22435555

PragerU can and should host their own videos if Google doesn&#x27;t want to (<i>edit</i>: though in this case the problem is not related to hosting but advertising, it seems?). Anyway, we can and should criticise Google for their partisan stances and they shouldn&#x27;t be treated with much sympathy if a conservative government retaliates in some way either, but that&#x27;s by the by.<p>The problem is that this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t have any limits. People were making the exact same argument when Google seized the domain of a source of unpopular speech such that the owners were not only unable to use Google&#x27;s services, but in fact, were unable to host themselves too. It was basically a DoS attack by a corporation on that site.<p>The internet is run entirely by private companies. What happens to your argument when someone <i>does</i> in fact stop PragerU from providing their own video platform that doesn&#x27;t censor content? For instance because an angry mob tries to shut down your ISP, or a DNS provider steals your domain, or a DDoS protection firm decides not to protect you anymore and then lets an anonymous mob take your servers offline?<p>Nobody at any point has violated the constitution, but the outcome is identical. Digital technology <i>requires</i> private sector collaboration.

This will happen slowly because conservatives don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to do that, but it <i>will</i> happen, especially as actual shrink-the-state conservatives don&#x27;t tend to get into leadership positions in the west.<p>Ultimately the right to criticise the government is a right to criticise those who have power. The arguments for it don&#x27;t change if the government outsources suppression of speech to contractors, and don&#x27;t change if a bunch of political allies manage to take control of organisations required to engage in speech.

sagarm,"I 100% agree with the title, but some of the complaints in this article have been addressed since the article was published by C++11, C++14, or C++17. Others are just weird.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;ve heard anything about C++, you&#x27;ve probably heard that there&#x27;s no standard string class and everybody rolls their own.<p>Is this still true? std::string seems perfectly reasonable now, especially now that they&#x27;ve given up on supporting ropes and integrated the small string optimization. Yes it doesn&#x27;t specify an encoding.<p>&gt; No garbage collection? Check. No refcounting? Check. Need to allocate&#x2F;free heap space just to pass a string constant to a function?<p>Nothing else in the standard library is garbage collected or refcounted by default. Why would std::string be the lone exception? You can opt into refcounting for any type using std::shared_ptr.<p>The objection about allocating&#x2F;freeing heap space is about APIs that take const std::string&amp; being passed C-string literals. Legitimate complaint, but it&#x27;s addressed by std::string_view now.<p>&gt;  ...rant about lack of []= operator...<p>[] mutating the map does surprise people, so that&#x27;s definitely a legitimate complaint. And it is annoying to have to use find() in a const context...<p>but simple operations like counting are simpler and more efficient in C++ than in Python because the +=, -=, etc operators work:<p><pre><code>  for value in list:
    counts[value] = counts.get(value, 0) + 1
</code></pre>
vs<p><pre><code>  for (auto&amp; value : list)
    counts[value]++;
</code></pre>
&gt; So actually C++ maps are as fast as python maps, assuming your compiler writers are amazingly great, and a) implement the (optional) return-value optimization; b) inline the right stuff; and c) don&#x27;t screw up their overcomplicated optimizer so that it makes your code randomly not work in other places.<p>This is just comical. Python is not playing in the same performance league as C++, regardless of whether inlining or RVO happens. RVO of course is a general optimization for returning objects by value from functions, not a special case to optimize setting map items. It&#x27;s still relevant, but less important since C++11&#x27;s move semantics.",42.15,22435888

jamesblonde,"Ant-colony optimization is a search algorithm that is inspired by observing the behaviour individual ants as they search for food and the emergent behaviour of the colony. Ants perform random search, unless they either (1) find food - then they way as direct a way back to the nest as they remember, laying down a trail of pheromones as they walk, or (2) they smell a pheromone trail and then follow it towards the source of food. When the source of food is exhausted, the pheromones evaporate, so they can forget what they have learnt. The emergent behaviour is that they can collectively solve problems such as finding the shortest path to food, or solving the NP-complete travelling salesman problem efficiently.<p>Reference:

If you asked them to verbalize their inputs they would probably use different words for the same symbol, signifying that the meaning or intent isn&#x27;t the same but even that isn&#x27;t entirely reliable.<p>You can attempt to infer intent or meaning based on the context of the input field but often the least-problematic method is to provide instruction&#x2F;hints with the field, examples of correctness, and real-time validation with specific syntax errors when invalid or unexpected data is provided.  I&#x27;d argue that it would also be worthwhile to request clarity from the user when an input hits a filtering rule so that they can make clear their intent... e.g. if you assume that they&#x27;re using &quot;-&quot; as a symbol for separation rather than simply follow that assumption, ask if that&#x27;s the case and list other optional valid contexts for that symbol so they can be explicit.  If they choose None of the Above or a context that is inappropriate for the field, inform them of that.<p>The 4-box credit card form, while pretty terrible in many ways, at least made explicit the expectations.  Often we now hide the expectations and either auto-reformat what was put in the field (which can be surprising to the user or worse can modify their input to mean something other than what they intended) or do hidden filtering, which can have the same problems but doesn&#x27;t even bother to inform the user of the changes.",40.19,22437047

I used to do some crime maps and some areas would look quite crime-ridden ... because they were areas with very little population, as the census counts it, like parks and such, so the crime would look rather high.  So dividing by population isn&#x27;t the cure-all, but it beats nothing.

If you want to know which are worth it, you have to evaluate each of the rules individually, because some may be worth it and others not.<p>Really evaluating 500,000 separate rules would take a large staff multiple lifetimes, so you still have to decide whether the bureaucracy as a whole is doing net good or net harm in order to determine whether it should be suspended for the years it will take to evaluate all the rules.<p>But by the time you finish the evaluation, years have passed since you started and the facts on the ground may have changed, or new rules proposed, so the evaluations are stale before they&#x27;re completed and you have to start over.<p>It leaves you with only the systemic question of whether large bureaucracies are a net positive force as an institution. The answer could reasonably be no.<p>But notice that the answer is also related to the size. Because if the bureaucracy is smaller, you can finish the evaluation sooner, possibly soon enough that the evaluation results are still relevant by the time you finish.

There are currently student groups across the US at universities who have advocated with their dining service providers to create a pipeline where in excess food from the dining service is packaged in food safe containers, brought to food rescue organizations, and then fed to people in need. This isnt &quot;cast off&quot; food either, its high quality prepared food. In the city I live in my spouse has started working with a local school district to get them to take the excess meals from school lunches, package it, and then allow school children to take it home. If you work at a company that has a cafeteria, there is a decent chance that the food service provider is already competing for the contract on not just the basis of cost, but on the steps they are taking to minimize food waste. That comes from just better planning, but also from the hierarchy of feeding first people, then animals, and then composting when it comes to excess food.<p>You dont have to try to solve poverty in the US, or fix the entire system, to make actionable change.

Have designers lost sight of the fact that 99% of people use their eyes when working with an interface?  You cannot simply hide the simplest visual cues and expect people to find out about them accidentally, or via a video or article like this.<p>My biggest gripe at the moment is the photo sharing option in the latest iOS.  The &#x27;Copy&#x27; or &#x27;Send To&#x27; options used to be immediately in front of you as buttons.  Now, they are hidden below a &#x27;swipe up&#x27; menu that resides off screen.  There is not even the simplest hint that you can swipe up, and it took me literally weeks of using the new iOS update to discover that purely by accident.<p>Why not have the visual clue by having the top bit of the first menu option just showing at the bottom of the screen?  That at least gives me as the user looking at the screen the idea that &quot;Hey, there&#x27;s something that goes off screen here - maybe I can swipe up a little to see it better...Ooooh - there is a whole menu hidden down there!&quot;.<p>UI&#x2F;UX Designers - STOP designing screens that look cool on your Dribbble, UpLabs and Behance portfolios and start designing screens that give people hints as to how the interface is to be used.

gmfawcett,"I think McIlroy missed the mark here.  Single points of entry, and tightly-coupled code, might be reasonable criticisms of Knuth&#x27;s personal style, but I don&#x27;t see them as inherent limitations of the LP approach.  You could write multiple useful, interesting narratives about a library&#x27;s core elements -- algorithms, data structures, etc., -- and then write a simple appendix documenting the entry points &#x2F; API. The style itself doesn&#x27;t have to get in the way of good program structure.<p>My own critique of LP is really more about the act of writing itself.  Many people, programmers included, just aren&#x27;t skilled at it! Knuth&#x27;s literate programs are interesting because he&#x27;s got something interesting to day, and his writing style is engaging. But I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy having to read (or maintain!) a literate program that was written by a poor writer in a dull, meandering style.<p>Also, Knuth seems to think that the literate style ought to make us into better programmers, simply <i>because</i> we&#x27;re writing prose along with the code -- that the combination somehow unlocks a better understanding of the problem, how to solve it, and how to explain it to others.

eitland,"&gt; A good UI can only ever have a limited number of discoverable actions.<p>Edit: FTR, this comment is kind of hyperbolic. I do not think I can outsmart all UX designers alone or that all UX designers are dumb or that those who designed Ribbon are dumb. I&#x27;m just pointing out that 1. I think there was a golden age of discoverability in UX where everything could be discovered and 2. It is over now.<p>Unless I misunderstand something here this should be plain demonstrably wrong (and note for context that I&#x27;m not exactly a Windows and Office enthusiast, quite the contrary):<p>In Microsoft Office (and a good number of other application) everything was available through the menus.<p>Toolbar buttons were just shortcuts fot the more important ones.<p>Then &quot;UX&quot; happened on Windows and today we&#x27;ve suffered through<p>- Office automatically hiding half the menus (late pre-Ribbon)<p>- early (but released, not Beta) Ribbon versions where File and Save was hidden behind a round flag that turned out to be a button.<p>- now: Ribbon is actually usable. Nice looking, still less predictable and more visual noise in addition to the leftmost menu (File...?) behaving in a (weirdly IMO) different way.<p>- now: menus are gone in many applications. I belive Chrome is the culprit here. Designers like Chrome it seems and for a number of UX-designers the idea seems to be that whatever Chrome and Mac OS does has to be copied across OS and domain boundaries.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t clear:<p>UX on Windows used to be great. The OS was closed, slow, annoyingly limited etc, the UI was kind of ugly and business-focused but the UX was discoverable and usable.<p>What should have been done? I don&#x27;t know but here are a couple of ideas:<p>- search in menus (as implemented in IDE settings, Visual Studio palette etc)?<p>- add fallback with synonyms and slight fuzzing to the search index so you get can the correct tool even if you misspelled it or if you are stuck on a Norwegian or French version.<p>- make enthusiastic videos about how it is best (I&#x27;m only half joking here, it seems to have worked for the vim crowd, - a number of people spend weeks learning a decades old editor whos discoverability is so bad no one knows how to even exit it the first time they open it.)",74.3,22440411

mercer,"&gt; If people are honestly this stupid, then why even bother polling them to see what policies they want? This is a serious question: if people don&#x27;t bother voting based on policies they want, then why is that even important? If this theory of yours is true, then it really seems to call the voting population&#x27;s basic intelligence into question, not to mention the fundamental idea of democracy itself. If the people are too utterly stupid to vote for their own best interests at least most of the time, then why wouldn&#x27;t authoritarianism be a better system?<p>All kinds of things play a role in this &#x27;stupidity&#x27;: tribalism, decades of anti-socialist propaganda, legitimate concerns based on history, and disengagement. It&#x27;s completely understandable that one could reject &#x27;socialism&#x27; and yet support most of what actual socialist argue in favor of.<p>&gt; Honestly, I find it easier to believe that the polls are bad. I&#x27;ve seen way too many polls in my lifetime where the questions were manipulative, or just plain poorly worded or chosen.<p>If you&#x27;re honestly engaging with me on this, and I&#x27;m hoping you are, I&#x27;d challenge both of us to do some research and further discuss this. I&#x27;m inclined to believe that in this case, with concrete policy questions, the questions and answers are not too manipulative, but of course I don&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; this. Let&#x27;s look into it.<p>&gt; On top of that, the other problem with polls is that they only capture results from people who actually bother to respond to the polls, or are in a place where the pollsters are. Usually, when the latter is brought up, we&#x27;re supposed to somehow believe that the pollsters have some great methodology that lets them determine what a larger population wants just by sampling a much smaller number of people in that population, but this is completely subject to bias and error.<p>True, but afaik this generally skews in favor of older, more conservative respondents and, crucially, more socalism-phobic, so to speak.<p>&gt; And finally, I point again to the 2016 election: predicting a winner is not as hard as asking if they want &lt;thing x&gt;. In this case, the poll is asking exactly the same thing as the election itself will: who do you plan to vote for? Asking about &lt;thing x&gt; is not as easy, because you can get wildly different results by asking the question differently. Do I want &quot;Medicare for All&quot;? Well, the answer might depend on many things, like how exactly it would be implemented. Is private insurance still allowed to exist as a supplement or alternative? Are non-citizens&#x2F;&quot;illegal aliens&quot;&#x2F;&quot;migrants&quot; (pick your term) covered? etc. You would probably get very different answers depending on those points in a large poll in America, so if you just ask a simple &quot;do you want it? yes&#x2F;no&quot; question, that might not align at all with what actual candidates are proposing. Asking &quot;who do you plan to vote for?&quot; avoids that. And in the 2016 election, the polls were nowhere even close to the election results. That tells me the polls were either garbage, or rigged to try to influence the election.<p>I think with the election polls one of the big issues is exactly the problem you describe earlier. Getting an accurate, representative sample is very difficult. Especially when voting for Trump was, for many people, a kind of social suicide.<p>That said, you might be right. I am inclined to believe that policy questions, even with all the hidden complication behind implementing said policies, are probably answered honestly and I&#x27;m assuming that the sampling is relatively &#x27;honest&#x27; too. But I don&#x27;t know this, and it&#x27;s absolutely fair to challenge me on that.<p>What I&#x27;ll do, one of these days, is look more into this because while I don&#x27;t think my beliefs depend on the accuracy of these polls, I do think it&#x27;s important that my beliefs are truthful (as well as my claims). If you&#x27;re not just interested in defending your beliefs or attacking mine (which I&#x27;m not saying you are), I&#x27;d very much like it if we could both look further into this and at some point continue the discussion with more than our respective assumptions :).

The error only occurred when the server was lightly loaded and could be mitigated by disabling the CPU C states entirely in the server configuration.

The farmer class worked the fields and were paid for their production, but owned nothing.  This was one of the big changes that was instituted by the Meiji restoration -- the samurai class was outlawed and farmers were allowed to own land (and have a name).<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feudalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feudalism</a> is a useful reference.  Of course Japan was not technically feudal, but the parallels with feudal Europe run deep, so most things I&#x27;ve read on the topic use that term.<p>One of the reasons I started avoiding conversations on HN of late is due to questions like this.  It&#x27;s appears to be a very shallow dismissal of what I was saying.  I really don&#x27;t mind if people disagree with me -- especially when I&#x27;m saying something as extreme as I have in this thread.  However, you seem to be saying that the upper classes treated the lower classes terribly badly and therefore nothing can be learned from that era.<p>Indeed, when I say that Japanese people admire Edo culture, they are not only, or even principally, speaking of the noble classes.  Indeed, most are referring to craftspeople, farmers, etc.  In fact, you will even see a considerable amount of respect and gratitude toward the Yakusa who generally protected normal people against the excesses of the powerful.  There is a reason for the huge number of Zatoichi movies out there, as well as all the ronin (disgraced samurai whose daimyo is dead, but who didn&#x27;t commit suicide) movies where the protagonist wanders around and protects the common people.<p>When the Meiji restoration came about, the government was keen to take on European culture and technology which it viewed as being more advanced compared to the seemingly backward analogies in Japan.  So suits and neckties came into fashion.  Brick and stone were used to build buildings, etc, etc.  Much of the appropriate cultural technology that had evolved to suit the climate and nature of Japan was thrown out the window.<p>Things like the natural life cycle of cloth was changed for example. Originally a parent would buy a kimono.  When it was worn, it was taken apart and a kimono was made for the children from it.  When it was worn, it was taken apart and cleaning cloths were made from it.  When it was worn, it was burned as fuel.  There was a general ban on burning firewood in parts of the Edo period because of over logging, and so people were very clever about how they got fuel.<p>Even now, if you go to a traditional futon store and try to buy a new futon the first thing the craftsperson will ask you is if you have old cotton from a futon or zabuton.  In fact, if you do not, they may heavily encourage you to go away and ask your family for old cushions and what-not as they are very loath to use new cotton if they can avoid it.  Again, this comes from the Edo traditions and is something that many people cherish in Japanese culture.  It&#x27;s also something that is slowly disappearing as the country becomes more westernised.<p>I hope you found the above interesting.  I probably shouldn&#x27;t complain about the quality of responses I get from crazy postings I make, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m starting to feel more acutely these days.  If you found what I wrote interesting, I hope you will find a way to encourage others to write something similar rather that to write in a way that may dismiss what they are saying out of hand.

DiogenesKynikos,"This is very poor history. A constant theme among apologists for the 17th Century Catholic Church is the claim that the Church was somehow defending scientific rigor. That idea is quickly dispelled by simply reading the Inquisition&#x27;s 1616 findings on heliocentrism:<p>&gt; Proposition to be assessed:<p>&gt; (1) The sun is the center of the world and completely devoid of local motion.<p>&gt;   Assessement: All said that this proposition is foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts many places the sense of Holy Scripture, according to the literal meaning of the words and according to the common interpretation and understanding of the Holy Fathers and the doctors of theology.<p>&gt; (2) The earth is not the center of the world, nor motionless, but it moves as a whole and also with diurnal motion.<p>&gt;   Assessment: All said that this proposition receives the same judgement in philosophy and that in regard to theological truth it is at least errouneous in faith.<p>The Church wasn&#x27;t calling for scientific rigor. It was calling for adherence to orthodoxy - in this case, its interpretation of Scripture.<p>Graney and others make an ahistorical argument: they cherry-pick one observation (the apparent angular diameter of stars), and then apply modern arguments not known to people at the time (the actual size of stars) to say that Galileo&#x27;s scientific argument was weak. They ignore all the other observations that strongly favored heliocentrism at the time (the phases of Venus, the discovery that Jupiter and its moons form their own Copernican system, the greater parsimony of the heliocentric system when it comes to explaining things like retrograde motion of planets, and so on), and focus on the argument about sizes of stars. But Galileo had a perfectly reasonable answer to the star-size argument: the stars might be very large, and different measurements of stellar angular diameters were inconsistent with one another. Countering with modern knowledge about the true sizes of stars doesn&#x27;t give any insight into who had the stronger argument in the early 1600s.<p>On balance, the argument for heliocentrism was already much stronger at the time.

These are your cashiers, your grocery store workers, the people who make your coffee - the service industry workers who make up the bulk of American labor. Even those workers who won&#x27;t get fired for taking sick days, often can&#x27;t afford it.  We&#x27;ve all seen the stats about the huge number of Americans who cannot afford an emergency expense of a few hundred dollars.  Staying home sick qualifies.  The containment efforts we&#x27;ve seen in South Korea and Italy have (so far) largely failed - and these are countries with universal healthcare and worker protections that we don&#x27;t have.  Right now it costs $3,200 to get tested for the coronavirus in the United States.  Not treated - just tested!  Working people cannot afford this and will not get tested, or treated - which will make the crisis worse.  How much will this crisis end up &quot;costing&quot; us in the long run?  If not this one, how much will the next, inevitable one cost us, because working people don&#x27;t have the income or benefits to take care of themselves?<p>Massive kudos to this guy for paying his workers a fair wage.  Hopefully other employers are enlightened enough to follow his lead and do the same, with the understanding that paying adequate wages benefits not only their business, but society and the economy at large.",49.39,22442499

sokoloff,"Yeah, you have described the essence of the problem. The game was quite realistic, enough that rookie Cup drivers would use the product to get familiar with tracks they&#x27;d not yet raced on, but that level of realism made it not so fun for the casual gamer. (It turns out that racing cars at the top professional level is actually <i>hard</i> and not something you pick up in 15 minutes.)<p>We would go to NASCAR events, weigh and measure car components, talk to the crews&#x2F;drivers, and most of us even got the first level of competition license (typically 3 full days of classroom and on-track instruction and then 3-6 more days of individual mostly track time) so we understood what driving a racing car near, at, and slightly over the limit was like.<p>The PSX product introduced a feature that later made it back to some of our PC titles, called &quot;Arcade Mode&quot;. It was still racing (in that skill mattered), but arcade mode gave the cars far better braking, allowed them to slide and pivot more but spin out less (by changing tire slip curves), and gave drag reduction to cars that were losing the race. We also introduced the smoky burnout&#x2F;donut ability which immediately made it into the PC title (but had a bug that caused a smoky burnout to be the fastest way to launch the car from a standing start, which critics [rightly] hated).<p>At the end of the day, fairly few people are interested in very realistic racing. (Many of the ex-Papyrus team are over at iRacing now and they&#x27;re on the ultra-realistic side of things.)

So much for popular progress? In Canada, women could vote in 1917. In Turkey, 1934. Finland, 1906. India, 1950.<p>The reason that Switzerland will be able to address the Coronavirus pandemic effectively will not be &#x27;direct democracy&#x27;, it will be wealth. Switzerland became wealthy largely due to a national economic strategy of banking secrecy, asset protection, and of course enabling evasion of taxation and other authorities. At almost 10% of the economy relative to assets under management, the banking sector in Switzerland is indeed substantially larger than other sectors relative to the sectors of other nations [1]. In the US it&#x27;s 1%. Canada 2%.<p>Luxembourg, in the last 70-ish years, went from a backwater to even wealthier than Switzerland on a GDP&#x2F;per-capita basis for similar reasons: it became a tax haven, a policy driven by no less than the outgoing EU Commission head JC Junker who was the PM of Lux. There is no real economy in Monaco, of course, but its high-income status is also derived from its special variation of tax haven. Even Irleand&#x27;s massive economic renaissance in the last 20 years has largely been driven by asymmetrical tax benefits for large American tech corporations. And of course, Norway&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund which owns 2% of all public stocks in the world is derived from another existential special economic bit: Oil.<p>When Corona hits, the &#x27;rich&#x27; countries will be the safest (I think the US may possibly be an exception), and I think it will have little to do with their relative forms of government.
